let's move ahead and take a sessions so let's move ahead and take a sessions so let's move ahead and take a look at our first topic which is history look at our first topic which is history look at our first topic which is history of artificial intelligence of artificial intelligence of artificial intelligence so guys the concept of artificial so guys the concept of artificial so guys the concept of artificial intelligence goes back to the classical intelligence goes back to the classical intelligence goes back to the classical ages under Greek mythology the concept ages under Greek mythology the concept ages under Greek mythology the concept of machines and mechanical men were well of machines and mechanical men were well of machines and mechanical men were well thought of so an example of this is thought of so an example of this is thought of so an example of this is Talos I don't know how many of you have Talos I don't know how many of you have Talos I don't know how many of you have heard of this Talos was a giant animated heard of this Talos was a giant animated heard of this Talos was a giant animated bronze Warrior who was programmed to bronze Warrior who was programmed to bronze Warrior who was programmed to guard the island of creit now these are guard the island of creit now these are guard the island of creit now these are just ideas nobody knows if this was just ideas nobody knows if this was just ideas nobody knows if this was actually implemented but machine actually implemented but machine actually implemented but machine learning and AI were thought of long ago learning and AI were thought of long ago learning and AI were thought of long ago now let's get back to to the 19th now let's get back to to the 19th now let's get back to to the 19th century now 1950 was speculated to be century now 1950 was speculated to be century now 1950 was speculated to be one of the most important years for the one of the most important years for the one of the most important years for the introduction of artificial intelligence introduction of artificial intelligence introduction of artificial intelligence in 1950 Alan Turing published a paper in in 1950 Alan Turing published a paper in in 1950 Alan Turing published a paper in which he speculated about the which he speculated about the which he speculated about the possibility of creating machines that possibility of creating machines that possibility of creating machines that think so he created what is known as the think so he created what is known as the think so he created what is known as the Turing test this test is basically used Turing test this test is basically used Turing test this test is basically used to determine whether or not a computer to determine whether or not a computer to determine whether or not a computer can think intelligently like a human can think intelligently like a human can think intelligently like a human being he noted that thinking is being he noted that thinking is being he noted that thinking is difficult to Define and wi is his famous difficult to Define and wi is his famous difficult to Define and wi is his famous touring test so basically if a machine touring test so basically if a machine touring test so basically if a machine can carry out a conversation that was can carry out a conversation that was can carry out a conversation that was indistinguishable from a conversation indistinguishable from a conversation indistinguishable from a conversation with a human being then it was with a human being then it was with a human being then it was reasonable to say that the machine is reasonable to say that the machine is reasonable to say that the machine is thinking meaning that the machine will thinking meaning that the machine will thinking meaning that the machine will pass the touring test now unfortunately pass the touring test now unfortunately pass the touring test now unfortunately up to this date we haven't found a up to this date we haven't found a up to this date we haven't found a machine that has fully cleared the machine that has fully cleared the machine that has fully cleared the touring test so the touring test was touring test so the touring test was touring test so the touring test was actually the first serious proposal in actually the first serious proposal in actually the first serious proposal in the philosophy of artificial the philosophy of artificial the philosophy of artificial intelligence followed by this was the intelligence followed by this was the intelligence followed by this was the era of 1951 this was also known as the era of 1951 this was also known as the era of 1951 this was also known as the game AI so in 1951 by using the fan Mark game AI so in 1951 by using the fan Mark game AI so in 1951 by using the fan Mark 1 machine of the University of 1 machine of the University of 1 machine of the University of Manchester a computer scientist known as Manchester a computer scientist known as Manchester a computer scientist known as Christopher straty wrote a checker Christopher straty wrote a checker Christopher straty wrote a checker program and at the same time a program program and at the same time a program program and at the same time a program was written for chess as well now these was written for chess as well now these was written for chess as well now these programs were later improved and redone programs were later improved and redone programs were later improved and redone but this was the first attempt at but this was the first attempt at but this was the first attempt at creating programs that could play chess creating programs that could play chess creating programs that could play chess or that could compete with humans in or that could compete with humans in or that could compete with humans in playing chess this is followed by the playing chess this is followed by the playing chess this is followed by the year 1956 year 1956 year 1956 now this is probably the most important now this is probably the most important now this is probably the most important year in the invention of AI because in year in the invention of AI because in year in the invention of AI because in 1956 for the first time the term 1956 for the first time the term 1956 for the first time the term artificial intelligence was coined all artificial intelligence was coined all artificial intelligence was coined all right so the term artificial right so the term artificial right so the term artificial intelligence was coined by John mcari at intelligence was coined by John mcari at intelligence was coined by John mcari at the Dartmouth conference in the Dartmouth conference in the Dartmouth conference in 1956 coming to the year 1959 the first 1956 coming to the year 1959 the first 1956 coming to the year 1959 the first AI laboratory was established this AI laboratory was established this AI laboratory was established this period marked the research era for AI so period marked the research era for AI so period marked the research era for AI so the first AI lab where research was the first AI lab where research was the first AI lab where research was performed is the MIT lab which which is performed is the MIT lab which which is performed is the MIT lab which which is still running till date in 1960 the still running till date in 1960 the still running till date in 1960 the first robot was introduced to the first robot was introduced to the first robot was introduced to the General Motors Assembly line in 1961 the General Motors Assembly line in 1961 the General Motors Assembly line in 1961 the first chatbot was invented all right now first chatbot was invented all right now first chatbot was invented all right now we have Siri we have Alexa but in 1961 we have Siri we have Alexa but in 1961 we have Siri we have Alexa but in 1961 there was a chatbot known as Eliza which there was a chatbot known as Eliza which there was a chatbot known as Eliza which was introduced this was followed by the was introduced this was followed by the was introduced this was followed by the famous IBM deep blue in 1997 the news famous IBM deep blue in 1997 the news famous IBM deep blue in 1997 the news broke down that IBM's deep blue beats broke down that IBM's deep blue beats broke down that IBM's deep blue beats the world champion Gary kasprow in the the world champion Gary kasprow in the the world champion Gary kasprow in the game of chess so this was kind of the game of chess so this was kind of the game of chess so this was kind of the first accomplishment of AI it was able first accomplishment of AI it was able first accomplishment of AI it was able to beat the world champion at chess so to beat the world champion at chess so to beat the world champion at chess so in 2005 when the DARPA Grand Challenge in 2005 when the DARPA Grand Challenge in 2005 when the DARPA Grand Challenge was held a robotic car named Stanley was held a robotic car named Stanley was held a robotic car named Stanley which was built by Stanford's racing which was built by Stanford's racing which was built by Stanford's racing team won the DARPA Grand Challenge that team won the DARPA Grand Challenge that team won the DARPA Grand Challenge that was another big accomplishment of EI in was another big accomplishment of EI in was another big accomplishment of EI in 2011 IBM's question answering system 2011 IBM's question answering system 2011 IBM's question answering system Watson defeated the two greatest Watson defeated the two greatest Watson defeated the two greatest Jeopardy champions Brad Reta and Ken Jeopardy champions Brad Reta and Ken Jeopardy champions Brad Reta and Ken Jennings so guys this was how AI evolved Jennings so guys this was how AI evolved Jennings so guys this was how AI evolved it started off as a hypothetical it started off as a hypothetical it started off as a hypothetical situation right now it's the most situation right now it's the most situation right now it's the most important technology in today's world important technology in today's world important technology in today's world right if you look around everywhere right if you look around everywhere right if you look around everywhere everything around us is run through AI everything around us is run through AI everything around us is run through AI deep learning or machine learning so deep learning or machine learning so deep learning or machine learning so since the emergence of AI in the 1950s since the emergence of AI in the 1950s since the emergence of AI in the 1950s we have actually seen an exponential we have actually seen an exponential we have actually seen an exponential growth in its potential so AI covers growth in its potential so AI covers growth in its potential so AI covers domains such as machine learning deep domains such as machine learning deep domains such as machine learning deep learning neural networks natural learning neural networks natural learning neural networks natural language processing knowledge based language processing knowledge based language processing knowledge based expert systems and so on it has also expert systems and so on it has also expert systems and so on it has also made its way into to computer vision and made its way into to computer vision and made its way into to computer vision and image processing now the question here image processing now the question here image processing now the question here is if AI has been here for over half a is if AI has been here for over half a is if AI has been here for over half a century why has it suddenly gain so much century why has it suddenly gain so much century why has it suddenly gain so much importance why are we talking about importance why are we talking about importance why are we talking about artificial intelligence now let me tell artificial intelligence now let me tell artificial intelligence now let me tell you the main reasons for the demand of you the main reasons for the demand of you the main reasons for the demand of AI the first reason is that we have more AI the first reason is that we have more AI the first reason is that we have more computational power now so artificial computational power now so artificial computational power now so artificial intelligence requires a lot of computing intelligence requires a lot of computing intelligence requires a lot of computing power recently many advances have been power recently many advances have been power recently many advances have been made and complex deep learning modules made and complex deep learning modules made and complex deep learning modules are deployed and one of the greatest are deployed and one of the greatest are deployed and one of the greatest technology that made this possible are technology that made this possible are technology that made this possible are gpus right since we have more gpus right since we have more gpus right since we have more computational power now it is possible computational power now it is possible computational power now it is possible for us to implement AI in our daily for us to implement AI in our daily for us to implement AI in our daily aspects second most important reason is aspects second most important reason is aspects second most important reason is that we have a lot of data at present that we have a lot of data at present that we have a lot of data at present we're generating data at an immeasurable we're generating data at an immeasurable we're generating data at an immeasurable Pace right we are generating data Pace right we are generating data Pace right we are generating data through social media through iot devices through social media through iot devices through social media through iot devices every possible way there's a lot of data every possible way there's a lot of data every possible way there's a lot of data so we need to find a method or a so we need to find a method or a so we need to find a method or a solution that can help us process this solution that can help us process this solution that can help us process this much data much data much data and help us derive useful insights so and help us derive useful insights so and help us derive useful insights so that we can grow businesses with the that we can grow businesses with the that we can grow businesses with the help of data right so that process is help of data right so that process is help of data right so that process is basically artificial intelligence so in basically artificial intelligence so in basically artificial intelligence so in order to have a useful AI agent to make order to have a useful AI agent to make order to have a useful AI agent to make smart decisions like telling which item smart decisions like telling which item smart decisions like telling which item to recommend you next when you shop to recommend you next when you shop to recommend you next when you shop online or how to classify an object from online or how to classify an object from online or how to classify an object from an image AI are trained on large data an image AI are trained on large data an image AI are trained on large data sets and Big Data enables us to do this sets and Big Data enables us to do this sets and Big Data enables us to do this more efficiently next reason is now we more efficiently next reason is now we more efficiently next reason is now we have better algorithms have better algorithms have better algorithms right now we have very effective right now we have very effective right now we have very effective algorithms which are based on the idea algorithms which are based on the idea algorithms which are based on the idea of neural networks neural networks is of neural networks neural networks is of neural networks neural networks is nothing but the concept behind deep nothing but the concept behind deep nothing but the concept behind deep learning since we have better algorithms learning since we have better algorithms learning since we have better algorithms which can do better computations and which can do better computations and which can do better computations and quicker computations with more accuracy quicker computations with more accuracy quicker computations with more accuracy the demand for AI has increased another the demand for AI has increased another the demand for AI has increased another reason is that universities governments reason is that universities governments reason is that universities governments startup and Tech Giants are all startup and Tech Giants are all startup and Tech Giants are all investing in AI okay so companies like investing in AI okay so companies like investing in AI okay so companies like Google Amazon Facebook Microsoft all of Google Amazon Facebook Microsoft all of Google Amazon Facebook Microsoft all of these companies have heavily invested in these companies have heavily invested in these companies have heavily invested in artificial intelligence because they artificial intelligence

artificial intelligence cars so artificial intelligence implements computer vision image implements computer vision image implements computer vision image detection deep learning in order to detection deep learning in order to detection deep learning in order to build cars that can automatically detect build cars that can automatically detect build cars that can automatically detect any objects or any obstacles and drive any objects or any obstacles and drive any objects or any obstacles and drive around without human intervention so around without human intervention so around without human intervention so these are fully automated self-driving these are fully automated self-driving these are fully automated self-driving cars also on musk talks a lot about how cars also on musk talks a lot about how cars also on musk talks a lot about how AI is implemented in Tesla's AI is implemented in Tesla's AI is implemented in Tesla's self-driving cars he quoted that Tesla self-driving cars he quoted that Tesla self-driving cars he quoted that Tesla will have fully self driving cars ready will have fully self driving cars ready will have fully self driving cars ready by the end of the year and a robo taxi by the end of the year and a robo taxi by the end of the year and a robo taxi version that can Ferry passengers version that can Ferry passengers version that can Ferry passengers without anyone behind the wheel so if without anyone behind the wheel so if without anyone behind the wheel so if you look at it AI is actually used by you look at it AI is actually used by you look at it AI is actually used by the tech Giants right a lot of Tech the tech Giants right a lot of Tech the tech Giants right a lot of Tech Giant companies like Google Tesla Giant companies like Google Tesla Giant companies like Google Tesla Facebook all of these datadriven Facebook all of these datadriven Facebook all of these datadriven companies in fact Netflix also makes use companies in fact Netflix also makes use companies in fact Netflix also makes use of AI right so coming to Netflix so so of AI right so coming to Netflix so so of AI right so coming to Netflix so so with the help of artificial intelligence with the help of artificial intelligence with the help of artificial intelligence and machine learning Netflix has and machine learning Netflix has and machine learning Netflix has developed personalized movie developed personalized movie developed personalized movie recommendations for each of its users recommendations for each of its users recommendations for each of its users right so if each of you open up Netflix right so if each of you open up Netflix right so if each of you open up Netflix and if you look at the type of movies and if you look at the type of movies and if you look at the type of movies that are recommended to you they are that are recommended to you they are that are recommended to you they are different this is because Netflix different this is because Netflix different this is because Netflix studies each user's personal details and studies each user's personal details and studies each user's personal details and tries to understand what each user is tries to understand what each user is tries to understand what each user is interested in and what sort of movie interested in and what sort of movie interested in and what sort of movie patterns each user has and then it patterns each user has and then it patterns each user has and then it recommends movies to them so Netflix recommends movies to them so Netflix recommends movies to them so Netflix uses the watching hisory of other users uses the watching hisory of other users uses the watching hisory of other users with similar taste to recommend what you with similar taste to recommend what you with similar taste to recommend what you may be most interested in watching next may be most interested in watching next may be most interested in watching next so that you can you know stay engaged so that you can you know stay engaged so that you can you know stay engaged and continue your monthly subscription and continue your monthly subscription and continue your monthly subscription also it is a known fact that over 75% of also it is a known fact that over 75% of also it is a known fact that over 75% of what you watch is recommended by Netflix what you watch is recommended by Netflix what you watch is recommended by Netflix so their recommendation engine is so their recommendation engine is so their recommendation engine is brilliant and the logic behind their brilliant and the logic behind their brilliant and the logic behind their recommendation engine is machine recommendation engine is machine recommendation engine is machine learning and artificial intelligence learning and artificial intelligence learning and artificial intelligence apart from Netflix Gmail also uses AI on apart from Netflix Gmail also uses AI on apart from Netflix Gmail also uses AI on a everyday basis if you open up your a everyday basis if you open up your a everyday basis if you open up your inbox right now you will notice that inbox right now you will notice that inbox right now you will notice that there are separate sections right for there are separate sections right for there are separate sections right for example we have primary section social example we have primary section social example we have primary section social section and all of that Gmail has a section and all of that Gmail has a section and all of that Gmail has a separate section called the spam meals separate section called the spam meals separate section called the spam meals also so what GMail does is it makes use also so what GMail does is it makes use also so what GMail does is it makes use of concepts of artificial intelligence of concepts of artificial intelligence of concepts of artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to and machine learning algorithms to and machine learning algorithms to classify emails as spam and non-spam classify emails as spam and non-spam classify emails as spam and non-spam many of times certain words or phrases many of times certain words or phrases many of times certain words or phrases are frequently used in spam emails if are frequently used in spam emails if are frequently used in spam emails if you notice your spam emails they have you notice your spam emails they have you notice your spam emails they have words like Lottery earn full refund all words like Lottery earn full refund all words like Lottery earn full refund all of this denotes that the email is more of this denotes that the email is more of this denotes that the email is more likely to be a Spam one so such words likely to be a Spam one so such words likely to be a Spam one so such words and correlations are understood by using and correlations are understood by using and correlations are understood by using machine learning and natural language machine learning and natural language machine learning and natural language processing and a few other aspects of processing and a few other aspects of processing and a few other aspects of artificial intelligence so Guys these artificial intelligence so Guys these artificial intelligence so Guys these were the common applications of were the common applications of were the common applications of artificial intelligence now let's artificial intelligence now let's artificial intelligence now let's discuss the different types of AI so AI discuss the different types of AI so AI discuss the different types of AI so AI is divided into three different is divided into three different is divided into three different evolutionary stages or you can say that evolutionary stages or you can say that evolutionary stages or you can say that there are three stages of artificial there are three stages of artificial there are three stages of artificial intelligence first we have artificial intelligence first we have artificial intelligence first we have artificial narrow intelligence followed by narrow intelligence followed by narrow intelligence followed by artificial general intelligence and that artificial general intelligence and that artificial general intelligence and that is followed by artificial super is followed by artificial super is followed by artificial super intelligence artificial narrow intelligence artificial narrow intelligence artificial narrow intelligence which is also known as weak intelligence which is also known as weak intelligence which is also known as weak AI it involves applying artificial AI it involves applying artificial AI it involves applying artificial intelligence only to specific tasks so intelligence only to specific tasks so intelligence only to specific tasks so many currently existing systems that many currently existing systems that many currently existing systems that claim to use artificial intelligence are claim to use artificial intelligence are claim to use artificial intelligence are actually operating as weak AI focused on actually operating as weak AI focused on actually operating as weak AI focused on a narrowly defined specific problem let a narrowly defined specific problem let a narrowly defined specific problem let me give you an example of artificial me give you an example of artificial me give you an example of artificial narrow intelligence Alexa is a very good narrow intelligence Alexa is a very good narrow intelligence Alexa is a very good example of vki it operates within a example of vki it operates within a example of vki it operates within a limited predefined range of functions limited predefined range of functions limited

the famous alphago fall under the category of week alphago fall under the category of week alphago fall under the category of week AI so guys right now we are at the stage AI so guys right now we are at the stage AI so guys right now we are at the stage of artificial narrow intelligence or we of artificial narrow intelligence or we of artificial narrow intelligence or we AI we haven't actually reached AI we haven't actually reached AI we haven't actually reached artificial general intelligence or artificial general intelligence or artificial general intelligence or artificial super intelligence but let's artificial super intelligence but let's artificial super intelligence but let's look at what exactly it would be like if look at what exactly it would be like if look at what exactly it would be like if you reach artificial general you reach artificial general you reach artificial general intelligence now artificial general intelligence now artificial general intelligence now artificial general intelligence which is also known as intelligence which is also known as intelligence which is also known as strong AI it involves machines that strong AI it involves machines that strong AI it involves machines that possess the ability to perform any possess the ability to perform any possess the ability to perform any intelligent task that a human being can intelligent task that a human being can intelligent task that a human being can now there's actually something that a now there's actually something that a now there's actually something that a lot of people don't realize machines lot of people don't realize machines lot of people don't realize machines don't possess humanlike abilities right don't possess humanlike abilities right don't possess humanlike abilities right they have a very very strong processing they have a very very strong processing they have a very very strong processing unit that can perform high level unit that can perform high level unit that can perform high level computations but they're not yet capable computations but they're not yet capable computations but they're not yet capable of doing the simple and the most of doing the simple and the most of doing the simple and the most reasonable things that a human being can reasonable things that a human being can reasonable things that a human being can now if you tell a machine to process now if you tell a machine to process now if you tell a machine to process like a million documents it'll probably like a million documents it'll probably like a million documents it'll probably do that in a matter of 10 seconds or a do that in a matter of 10 seconds or a do that in a matter of 10 seconds or a minute or even 10 minutes but if you ask minute or even 10 minutes but if you ask minute or even 10 minutes but if you ask a machine to walk up to your living room a machine to walk up to your living room a machine to walk up to your living room and switch on the TV a machine will take and switch on the TV a machine will take and switch on the TV a machine will take forever to learn that because machines forever to learn that because machines forever to learn that because machines don't have the reasonable way of don't have the reasonable way of don't have the reasonable way of thinking they have a very strong thinking they have a very strong thinking they have a very strong Processing Unit but they're not yet Processing Unit but they're not yet Processing Unit but they're not yet capable of thinking and reasoning like a capable of thinking and reasoning like a capable of thinking and reasoning like a human being so that's exactly why we're human being so that's exactly why we're human being so that's exactly why we're still stuck on artificial narrow still stuck on artificial narrow still stuck on artificial narrow intelligence so far we haven't developed intelligence so far we haven't developed intelligence so far we haven't developed any machine that can fully be called any machine that can fully be called any machine that can fully be called strong AI even though there are examples strong AI even though there are examples strong AI even though there are examples of alphao zero which defeated Alpha go of alphao zero which defeated Alpha go of alphao zero which defeated Alpha go in the game of Go alphao zero basically in the game of Go alphao zero basically in the game of Go alphao zero basically learned in a span of four months right learned in a span of four months right learned in a span of four months right it learned on its own without any human it learned on its own without any human it learned on its own without any human intervention but even then it was not intervention but even then it was not intervention but even then it was not classified as a fully strong artificial classified as a fully strong artificial classified as a fully strong artificial intelligence because it cannot reason intelligence because it cannot reason intelligence because it cannot reason like a human being moving on to like a human being moving on to like a human being moving on to artificial super intelligence now this artificial super intelligence now this artificial super intelligence now this is a term refering to the time when the is a term refering to the time when the is a term refering to the time when the capabilities of a computer will surpass capabilities of a computer will surpass capabilities of a computer will surpass that of a human being in all actuality that of a human being in all actuality that of a human being in all actuality it'll take a while for this to achieve it'll take a while for this to achieve it'll take a while for this to achieve artificial super

hypothetical situation as depicted in movies and any science depicted in movies and any science depicted in movies and any science fiction books wherein machines have fiction books wherein machines have fiction books wherein machines have taken over the World movies like taken over the World movies like taken over the World movies like Terminator and all of that depict Terminator and all of that depict Terminator and all of that depict artificial super intelligence now these artificial super intelligence now these artificial super intelligence now these don't exist yet which we should be don't exist yet which we should be don't exist yet which we should be thankful for but there are a lot of thankful for but there are a lot of thankful for but there are a lot of people who speculate that artificial people who speculate that artificial people who speculate that artificial super intelligence will take over the super intelligence will take over the super intelligence will take over the world by the year 2040 so Guys these world by the year 2040 so Guys these world by the year 2040 so Guys these were the different types or different were the different types or different were the different types or different stages of artificial intelligence to stages of artificial intelligence to stages of artificial intelligence to summarize everything like I said before summarize everything like I said before summarize everything like I said before narrow intelligence is the only thing narrow intelligence is the only thing narrow intelligence is the only thing that exists for now we have only weak AI that exists for now we have only weak AI that exists for now we have only weak AI or weak artificial intelligence all the or weak artificial intelligence all the or weak artificial

actually gaining tell you that python is actually gaining unbelievably huge momentum in AI right unbelievably huge momentum in AI right unbelievably huge momentum in AI right the language is used to develop data the language is used to develop data the language is used to develop data science algorithms machine learning science algorithms machine learning science algorithms machine learning algorithms and iot projects there other algorithms and iot projects there other algorithms and iot projects there other advantages to python also the fact that advantages to python also the fact that advantages to python also the fact that you don't have to code much when it you don't have to code much when it you don't have to code much when it comes to python for AI or machine comes to python for AI or machine comes to python for AI or machine learning this is because there are learning this is because there are learning this is because there are readymade packages there are predefined readymade packages there are predefined readymade packages there are predefined packages that have all the functions and packages that have all the functions and packages that have all the functions and algorithms stor for example there is algorithms stor for example there is algorithms stor for example there is something known as py brain which can be something known as py brain which can be something known as py brain which can be used for machine learning numpy which used for machine learning numpy which used for machine learning numpy which can be used for scientific computation can be used for scientific computation can be used for scientific computation pandas and so on there are a number of pandas and so on there are a number of pandas and so on there are a number of libraries in Python so guys I'm not libraries in Python so guys I'm not libraries in Python so guys I'm not going to go into depth of python right going to go into depth of python right going to go into depth of python right I'm not going to explain python to you I'm not going to explain python to you I'm not going to explain python to you since this session is about artificial since this session is about artificial since this session is about artificial intelligence so those of you who don't intelligence so those of you who don't intelligence so those of you who don't know much about python or who are new to know much about python or who are new to know much about python or who are new to python I will leave a couple of links in python I will leave a couple of links in python I will leave a couple of links in the description box you all can get the description box you all can get the description box you all can get started with program in and any other started with program in and any other started with program in and any other Concepts or any other doubts that you Concepts or any other doubts that you Concepts or any other doubts that you have on python right we have a lot of have on python right we have a lot of have on python right we have a lot of content around programming with python content around programming with python content around programming with python or python for machine learning and so on or python for machine learning and so on or python for machine learning and so on now let's move on and talk about one of now let's move on and talk about one of now let's move on and talk about one of the most important aspects of artificial the most important aspects of artificial the most important aspects of artificial intelligence which is machine learning intelligence which is machine learning intelligence which is machine learning now a lot of people always ask me this now a lot of people always ask me this now a lot of people always ask me this question is machine learning and question is machine learning and question is machine learning and artificial intelligence the same thing artificial intelligence the same thing artificial intelligence the same thing well both of them are not the same thing well both of them are not the same thing well both of them are not the same thing the difference between Ai and machine the difference between Ai and machine the difference between Ai and machine learning is that machine learning is learning is that machine learning is learning is that machine learning is used in artificial intelligence machine used in artificial intelligence machine used in artificial intelligence machine learning is a method through which you learning is a method through which you learning is a method through which you can feed a lot of data to a machine and can feed a lot of data to a machine and can feed a lot of data to a machine and make it learn now ai is a vaster field make it learn now ai is a vaster field make it learn now ai is a vaster field under AI we have machine learning we under AI we have machine learning we under AI we have machine learning we have NLP we have expert systems we have have NLP we have expert systems we have have NLP we have expert systems we have image recognition object detection and image recognition object detection and image recognition object detection and so on we have deep learning also so AI so on we have deep learning also so AI so on we have deep learning also so AI is sort of a process or it's a is sort of a process or it's a is sort of a process or it's a methodology in which you make machines methodology in which you make machines methodology in which you make machines mimic the behavior of human beings mimic the behavior of human beings mimic the behavior of human beings machine learning is a way in which you machine learning is a way in which you machine learning is a way in which you feed a lot of data to a machine so that feed a lot of data to a machine so that feed a lot of data to a machine so that it can make its own decisions let's get it can make its own decisions let's get it can make its own decisions let's get into depth about machine learning so into depth about machine learning so into depth about machine learning so first we'll understand the need for first we'll understand the need for first we'll understand the need for machine learning or why machine learning machine learning or why machine learning machine learning or why machine learning came into existence now the need for came into existence now the need for came into existence now the need for machine learning began since the machine learning began since the machine learning began since the technical Revolution itself so guys technical Revolution itself so guys technical Revolution itself so guys since technology became the center of since technology became the center of since technology became the center of everything we've been generating an

timec consuming steps in machine learning process right if you in machine learning process right if you in machine learning process right if you have to go manually and collect the data have to go manually and collect the data have to go manually and collect the data it's going to take a lot of time but it's going to take a lot of time but it's going to take a lot of time but lucky for us there are lot of resources lucky for us there are lot of resources lucky for us there are lot of resources online which provide uh data sets right online which provide uh data sets right online which provide uh data sets right all you have to do is web scraping or all you have to do is web scraping or all you have to do is web scraping or you just have to go ahead and download you just have to go ahead and download you just have to go ahead and download data one of the websites I can tell you data one of the websites I can tell you data one of the websites I can tell you all about is kagle right so if you're a all about is kagle right so if you're a all about is kagle right so if you're a beginner in machine learning don't worry beginner in machine learning don't worry beginner in machine learning don't worry about data Gathering and all of that all about data Gathering and all of that all about data Gathering and all of that all you have to do is go to websites such as you have to do is go to websites such as you have to do is go to websites such as kaggle and just download a data set so kaggle and just download a data set so kaggle and just download a data set so coming back to the problem that we are coming back to the problem that we are coming back to the problem that we are discussing which is predicting the discussing which is predicting the discussing which is predicting the weather the data needed for weather weather the data needed for weather weather the data needed for weather forecasting includes measures like forecasting includes measures like forecasting includes measures like humidity level the temperature the humidity level the temperature the humidity level the temperature the measure the locality whether or not you measure the locality whether or not you measure the locality whether or not you live in a hill station such data has to live in a hill station such data has to live in a hill station such data has to be collected and stored for analysis be collected and stored for analysis be collected and stored for analysis right so all the data is collected right so all the data is collected right so all the data is collected during the data Gathering stage this during the data Gathering stage this during the data Gathering stage this step is followed by data preparation or step is followed by data preparation or step is followed by data preparation or also known as data cleaning right so if also known as data cleaning right so if also known as data cleaning right so if you're going around collecting data it's you're going around collecting data it's you're going around collecting data it's almost never in the right format and almost never in the right format and almost never in the right format and even if you are taking data from uh even if you are taking data from uh even if you are taking data from uh online resources from any website even online resources from any website even online resources from any website even then the data will require cleaning and then the data will require cleaning and then the data will require cleaning and preparation all right the data is never preparation all right the data is never preparation all right the data is never in the right format you have to do some in the right format you have to do some in the right format you have to do some sort of preparation and some sort of sort of preparation and some sort of sort of preparation and some sort of cleaning in order to make the data ready cleaning in order to make the data ready cleaning in order to make the data ready for analysis so what you'll encounter for analysis so what you'll encounter for analysis so what you'll encounter while cleaning data is you'll encounter while cleaning data is you'll encounter while cleaning data is you'll encounter a lot of inconsistencies in the data set a lot of inconsistencies in the data set a lot of inconsistencies in the data set like you'll encounter some missing like you'll encounter some missing like you'll encounter some missing values redundant variables duplicate values redundant variables duplicate values redundant variables duplicate values and all of that so removing such values and all of that so removing such values and all of that so removing such inconsistencies is very important inconsistencies is very important inconsistencies is very important because they might lead to any wrongful because they might lead to any wrongful because they might lead to any wrongful computations and predictions okay so at computations and predictions okay so at computations and predictions okay so at this stage you can scan the data set for this stage you can scan the data set for this stage you can scan the data set for any consistencies and you can fix them any consistencies and you can fix them any consistencies and you can fix them then and there now let me give you a then and there now let me give you a then and there now let me give you a small fact about data cleaning so there small fact about data cleaning so there small fact about data cleaning so there was a survey that was done last year or was a survey that was done last year or was a survey that was done last year or so I'm not sure and a lot of data so I'm not sure and a lot of data so I'm not sure and a lot of data scientists were asked which Step was the scientists were asked which Step was the scientists were asked which Step was the most difficult or the most annoying and most difficult or the most annoying and most difficult or the most annoying and time consuming of all and 80% of the time consuming of all and 80% of the time consuming of all and 80% of the data scientists said it was Data data scientists said it was Data data scientists said it was Data cleaning right data cleaning takes up cleaning right data cleaning takes up cleaning right data cleaning takes up 80% of their time so it's not very easy 80% of their time so it's not very easy 80% of their time so it's not very easy to get rid of missing values and to get rid of missing values and to get rid of missing values and corrupted data and even if you get rid corrupted data and even if you get rid corrupted data and even if you get rid of missing values sometimes your data of missing values sometimes your data of missing values sometimes your data set might get affected right it might set might get affected right it might set might get affected right it might get biased because maybe one variable get biased because maybe one variable get biased because maybe one variable has too many missing values and this has too many missing values and this has too many missing values and this will affect your outcome so you'll have will affect your outcome so you'll have will affect your outcome so you'll have to fix such issues you'll have to deal to fix such issues you'll have to deal to fix such issues you'll have to deal with all of this missing data and with all of this missing data and with all of this missing data and corrupted data right so data cleaning is corrupted data right so data cleaning is corrupted data right so data cleaning is actually one of the hardest steps in actually one of the hardest steps in actually one of the hardest steps in machine learning process okay now let's machine learning process okay now let's machine learning process okay now let's move on and look at our next step which move on and look at our next step which move on and look at our next step which is exploratory data analysis so here is exploratory data analysis so here is exploratory data analysis so here what you do is you basically become a what you do is you basically become a what you do is you basically become a detective in this stage so this stage detective in this stage so this stage detective in this stage so this stage which is Eda or exploratory data which is Eda or exploratory data which is Eda or exploratory data analysis is like the brainstorming stage analysis is like the brainstorming stage analysis is like the brainstorming stage of machine learning data exploration of machine learning data exploration of machine learning data exploration involves understanding the patterns and involves understanding the patterns and involves understanding the patterns and the trends in your data all right so at the trends in your data all right so at the trends in your data all right so at this stage all the useful insights are this stage all the useful insights are this stage all the useful insights are drawn and any correlations between the drawn and any correlations between the drawn and any correlations between the various variables are understood what do various variables are understood what do various variables are understood what do I mean by Trends and patterns and I mean by Trends and patterns and I mean by Trends and patterns and correlations now let's consider our correlations now let's consider our correlations now let's consider our example which is we have to predict the example which is we have to predict the example which is we have to predict the rainfall on a particular day so we know rainfall on a particular day so we know rainfall on a particular day so we know that there is a strong possibility of that there is a strong possibility of that there is a strong possibility of rain if the temperature has fallen low rain if the temperature has fallen low rain if the temperature has fallen low all right so we know that our output all right so we know that our output all right so we know that our output will depend on variables such as will depend on variables such as will depend on variables such as temperature humidity and so on now to temperature humidity and so on now to temperature humidity and so on now to what level it depends on these variables what level it depends on these variables what level it depends on these variables we'll have to find out that right we'll we'll have to find out that right we'll we'll have to find out that right we'll have to find out the patterns and we'll have to find out the patterns and we'll have to find out the patterns and we'll have to find out the correlations have to find out the correlations have to find out the correlations between such variables so such patterns between such variables so such patterns between such variables so such patterns and Trends have to be understood and and Trends have to be understood and and Trends have to be understood and mapped at this stage all right so this mapped at this stage all right so this mapped at this stage all right so this is what exploitatory data analysis is is what exploitatory data analysis is is what exploitatory data analysis is about it's the most important part of about it's the most important part of about it's the most important part of machine learning this is where you'll machine learning this is where you'll machine learning this is where you'll understand what exactly your data is and understand what exactly your data is and understand what exactly your data is and how you can form the solution to your how you can form the solution to your how you can form the solution to your problem all right the next step in a problem all right the next step in a problem all right the next step in a machine learning process is building a machine learning process is building a machine learning process is building a machine learning model so all the machine learning model so all the machine learning model so all the insights and the patterns that you insights and the patterns that you insights and the patterns that you derive during the data exploration are derive during the data exploration are derive during the data exploration are used to build the machine learning model used to build the machine learning model used to build the machine learning model so this stage always Begins by splitting so this stage always Begins by splitting so this stage always Begins by splitting the data set into two parts which is the data set into two parts which is the data set into two parts which is training data and testing data I already training data and testing data I already training data and testing data I already discussed with you that the data that discussed with you that the data that discussed with you that the data that you use in a machine learning process is you use in a machine learning process is you use in a machine learning process is always split into two parts right we always split into two parts right we always split into two parts right we have the training data and we have the have the training data and we have the have the training data and we have the testing data now when you're building a testing data now when you're building a testing data now when you're building a model you always use the training data model you always use the training data model you always use the training data so you always make use of the training so you always make use of the training so you always make use of the training data in order to build the model now a data in order to build the model now a data in order to build the model now a lot of you might be asking what is lot of you might be asking what is lot of you might be asking what is training data like is it different from training data like is it different from training data like is it different from the input data that you're feeding to the input data that you're feeding to the input data that you're feeding to the machine or is it different from the the machine or is it different from the the machine or is it different from the testing data now training data is the testing data now training data is the testing data now training data is the same input data that you're feeding to same input data that you're feeding to same input data that you're feeding to the machine the only difference is that the machine the only difference is that the machine the only difference is that you're splitting the data set into two you're splitting the data set into two you're splitting the data set into two right you're randomly picking 80% of right you're randomly picking 80% of right you're randomly picking 80% of your data and you're assigning it for your data and you're assigning it for your data and you're assigning it for training purpose and the rest 20% training purpose and the rest 20% training purpose and the rest 20% probably you'll assign it for testing probably you'll assign it for testing probably you'll assign it for testing purpose all right so guys always purpose all right so guys always purpose all right so guys always remember another thing that the training remember another thing that the training remember another thing that the training data is always much more than your data is always much more than your data is always much more than your testing data right obviously because you testing data right obviously because you testing data right obviously because you need to train your machine and the more need to train your machine and the more need to train your machine and the more data you fee the machine during the data you fee the machine during the data you fee the machine during the training phase the better it will be training phase the better it will be training phase the better it will be during the testing phase all right during the testing phase all right during the testing phase all right obviously it'll predict better outcomes obviously it'll predict better outcomes obviously it'll predict better outcomes if it is being trained on more data if it is being trained on more data if it is being trained on more data correct so the model is basically using correct so the model is basically using correct so the model is basically using the machine learning algorithm that the machine learning algorithm that the machine learning algorithm that predicts the output by using the data predicts the output by using the data predicts the output by using the data fed to it now in the case of predicting fed to it now in the case of predicting fed to it now in the case of predicting rainfall the output will be a rainfall the output will be a rainfall the output will be a categorical variable right because we'll categorical variable right because we'll categorical variable right because we'll be predicting whether it's going to rain be predicting whether it's going to rain be predicting whether it's going to rain or not okay so let's say we have a or not okay so let's say we have a or not okay so let's say we have a output variable called rain right the output variable called rain right the output variable called rain right the two possible values that this variable two possible values that this variable two possible values that this variable can take is yes it's going to rain and can take is yes it's going to rain and can take is yes it's going to rain and no it won't rain correct so that is our no it won't rain correct so that is our no it won't rain correct so that is our outcome our outcome is a classification outcome our outcome is a classification outcome our outcome is a classification or a categorical variable so for such or a categorical variable so for such or a categorical variable so for such cases where your outcome is a cases where your outcome is a cases where your outcome is a categorical variable you'll be using categorical variable you'll be using categorical variable you'll be using classification algorithms okay an classification algorithms okay an classification algorithms okay an example of a classification algorithm is example of a classification algorithm is example of a classification algorithm is logistic regression or you can also use logistic regression or you can also use logistic regression or you can also use support Vector machines you can use K support Vector machines you can use K support Vector machines you can use K nearest neighbor and you can also use nearest neighbor and you can also use nearest neighbor and you can also use naive bias and so on now don't worry naive bias and so on now don't worry naive bias and so on now don't worry about these terms I'll be discussing all about these terms I'll be discussing all about these terms I'll be discussing all these algorithms with you but just these algorithms with you but just these algorithms with you but just remember that while you're building a remember that while you're building a remember that while you're building a machine learning model you'll make use machine learning model you'll make use machine learning model you'll make use of the training data you'll train the of the training data you'll train the of the training data you'll train the model by using the training data and the model by using the training data and the model by using the training data and the Machine learning algorithm now like I Machine learning algorithm now like I Machine learning algorithm now like I said choosing the machine learning said choosing the machine learning said choosing the machine learning algorithm depends on the problem algorithm depends on the problem algorithm depends on the problem statement that you're trying to solve statement that you're trying to solve statement that you're trying to solve because there n number of machine because there n number of machine because there n number of machine learning algorithms you'll have to learning algorithms you'll have to learning algorithms you'll have to choose the algorithm that is the most choose the algorithm that is the most choose the algorithm that is the most suitable for your problem statement so suitable for your problem statement so suitable for your problem statement so step number six is model evaluation and step number six is model evaluation and step number six is model evaluation and optimization now after you've done optimization now after you've done optimization now after you've done building a model by using the training building a model by using the training building a model by using the training data set it is finally time to put the data set it is finally time to put the data set it is finally time to put the model to a test right the testing data model to a test right the testing data model to a test right the testing data set is used to check the efficiency of set is used to check the efficiency of set is used to check the efficiency of the model and how accurately it can the model and how accurately it can the model and how accurately it can predict the outcome so once the accuracy predict the outcome so once the accuracy predict the outcome so once the accuracy is calculated any further improvements is calculated any further improvements is calculated any further improvements in the model can be implemented during in the model can be implemented during in the model can be implemented during this stage there are various methods this stage there are various methods this stage there are various methods that can help you improve the that can help you improve the that can help you improve the performance of the model like you can performance of the model like you can performance of the model like you can use parameter tuning and cross use parameter tuning and cross use parameter tuning and cross validation methods in order to improve validation methods in order to improve validation methods in order to improve the performance of the model now the the performance of the model now the the performance of the model now the main things you need to remember during main things you need to remember during main things you need to remember during model evaluation and optimization is model evaluation and optimization is model evaluation and optimization is that model evaluation is nothing but that model evaluation is nothing but that model evaluation is nothing but you're testing how well your model can you're testing how well your model can you're testing how well your model can predict the outcome right so at this predict the outcome right so at this predict the outcome right so at this stage you will be using the testing data stage you will be using the testing data stage you will be using the testing data set in the previous stage which was set in the previous stage which was set in the previous stage which was building a model you'll be using the building a model you'll be using the building a model you'll be using the training data set but in the model training data set but in the model training data set but in the model evaluation stage you'll be using the evaluation stage you'll be using the evaluation stage you'll be using the testing data set now once you've tested testing data set now once you've tested testing data set now once you've tested your model you need to calculate the your model you need to calculate the your model you need to calculate the accuracy right you need to calculate how accuracy right you need to calculate how accuracy right you need to calculate how accurately your model is predicting the accurately your model is predicting the accurately your model is predicting the outcome after that if you find that you outcome after that if you find that you outcome after that if you find that you need to improve your model in some way need to improve your model in some way need to improve your model in some way or the other because the accuracy is not or the other because the accuracy is not or the other because the accuracy is not very good then you'll use method such as very good then you'll use method such as very good then you'll use method such as parameter tuning right don't worry about parameter tuning right don't worry about parameter tuning right don't worry about these terms I'll discuss all of this these terms I'll discuss all of this these terms I'll discuss all of this with you but I'm just trying to make with you but I'm just trying to make with you but I'm just trying to make sure that you're understanding the sure that you're understanding the sure that you're understanding the concept behind each of the phases in concept behind each of the phases in concept behind each of the phases in machine learning it's very important you machine learning it's very

last stage of machine on and look at the last stage of machine on and look at the last stage of machine learning which is predictions now once learning which is predictions now once learning which is predictions now once the model is evaluated and once you've the model is evaluated and once you've the model is evaluated and once you've improved it it is finally used to make improved it it is finally used to make improved it it is finally used to make predictions the final output can either predictions the final output can either predictions the final output can either be a categorical variable or a be a categorical variable or a be a categorical variable or a continuous variable now all of this continuous variable now all of this continuous variable now all of this depends on your problem statement right depends on your problem statement right depends on your problem statement right don't get confused about continuous don't get confused about continuous don't get confused about continuous variables categorical variables I'll be variables categorical variables I'll be variables categorical variables I'll be discussing all of this now in our case discussing all of this now in our case discussing all of this now in our case because we're predicting the occurrence because we're predicting the occurrence because we're predicting the occurrence of rainfall the output will be of rainfall the output will be of rainfall the output will be categorical variable right it's obvious categorical variable right it's obvious categorical variable right it's obvious because we are predicting whether it's because we are predicting whether it's because we are predicting whether it's going to rain or not there itself we going to rain or not there itself we going to rain or not there itself we understand that this is a classification understand that this is a classification understand that this is a classification problem because we have a categorical problem because we have a categorical problem because we have a categorical variable so that was the entire machine variable so that was the entire machine variable so that was the entire machine learning process now it's time to learn learning process now it's time to learn learning process now it's time to learn about the different ways in which about the different ways in which about the different ways in which machines can learn all right so let's machines can learn all right so let's machines can learn all right so let's move ahead and look at the types of move ahead and look at the types of move ahead and look at the types of machine learning now this is one of the machine learning now this is one of the machine learning now this is one of the most interesting Concepts in machine most interesting Concepts in machine most interesting Concepts in machine learning the three different ways in learning the three different ways in learning the three different ways in which machines learn all right there is which machines learn all right there is which machines learn all right there is something known as supervised learning something known as supervised learning something known as supervised learning unsupervised learning and reinforcement unsupervised learning and reinforcement unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning so we'll go through this one by learning so we'll go through this one by learning so we'll go through this one by one all right we'll understand what one all right we'll understand what one all right we'll understand what supervised learning is first and then supervised learning is first and then supervised learning is first and then we'll look at the other two types to we'll look at the other two types to we'll look at the other two types to Define supervised learning it is Define supervised learning it is Define supervised learning it is basically a technique in which we teach basically a technique in which we teach basically a technique in which we teach or train the Machine by using the data or train the Machine by using the data or train the Machine by using the data which is well labeled all right now in which is well labeled all right now in which is well labeled all right now in order to understand uh superise learning order to understand uh superise learning order to understand uh superise learning let's consider a small example so as let's consider a small example so as let's consider a small example so as kids we all needed guidance to solve kids we all needed guidance to solve kids we all needed guidance to solve math problems right a lot of us had math problems right a lot of us had math problems right a lot of us had trouble solving math problems so our trouble solving math problems so our trouble solving math problems so our teachers always helped us understand teachers always helped us understand teachers always helped us understand what addition is and how it is done what addition is and how it is done what addition is and how it is done similarly you can think of supervised similarly you can think of supervised similarly you can think of supervised learning as a type of machine learning learning as a type of machine learning learning as a type of machine learning that involves a guide all right the that involves a guide all right the that involves a guide all right the label data set is a feacher that will label data set is a feacher that will label data set is a feacher that will train you to understand the patterns in train you to understand the patterns in train you to understand the patterns in the data so the label data set is the data so the label data set is the data so the label data set is nothing but the training data set I'll nothing but the training data set I'll nothing but the training data set I'll explain more about this in a while so to explain more about this in a while so to explain more about this in a while so to understand supervised learning better understand supervised learning better understand supervised learning better let's look at the figure on the screen let's look at the figure on the screen let's look at the figure on the screen right here we are feeding the machine right here we are feeding the machine right here we are feeding the machine images of Tom and Jerry and the goal is images of Tom and Jerry and the goal is images of Tom and Jerry and the goal is for the machine to identify and classify for the machine to identify and classify for the machine to identify and classify the images into two classes one will the images into two classes one will the images into two classes one will contain images of Tom and the other will contain images of Tom and the other will contain images of Tom and the other will contain images of Jerry now the main contain images of Jerry now the main contain images of Jerry now the main thing that you need to note in thing that you need to note in thing that you need to note in supervised learning is a training data supervised learning is a training data supervised learning is a training data set the training data set is going to be set the training data set is going to be set the training data set is going to be very well labeled now what do I mean very well labeled now what do I mean very well labeled now what do I mean when I say that training data set is when I say that training data set is when I say that training data set is labeled basically what we're doing is labeled basically what we're doing is labeled basically what we're doing is we're telling the machine this is how we're telling the machine this is how we're telling the machine this is how Tom looks and this is how Jerry looks by Tom looks and this is how Jerry looks by Tom looks and this is how Jerry looks by doing this you're training the Machine doing this you're training the Machine doing this you're training the Machine by using label data so the main thing by using label data so the main thing by using label data so the main thing that you're doing here is you're that you're doing here is you're that you're doing here is you're labeling every input data that you're labeling every input data that you're labeling every input data that you're feeding to the model so basically your feeding to the model so basically your feeding to the model so basically your entire training data set is labeled all entire training data set is labeled all entire training data set is labeled all right whenever you're giving an image of right whenever you're giving an image of right whenever you're giving an image of Tom there's going to be a label there Tom there's going to be a label there Tom there's going to be a label there saying this is Tom and when you're saying this is Tom and when you're saying this is Tom and when you're giving an image of Jerry you're saying giving an image of Jerry you're saying giving an image of Jerry you're saying that this is how Jerry looks all right that this is how Jerry looks all right that this is how Jerry looks all right so basically you're guiding the machine so basically you're guiding the machine so basically you're guiding the machine and you're telling that listen this is and you're telling that listen this is and you're telling that listen this is how Tom looks this is how Jerry looks how Tom looks this is how Jerry looks how Tom looks this is how Jerry looks and now you need to classify them into and now you need to classify them into and now you need to classify them into two different classes all right that's two different classes all right that's two different classes all right that's how supervised Learning Works apart from how supervised Learning Works apart from how supervised Learning Works apart from that it's the same old process after that it's the same old process after that it's the same old process after getting the input data you're going to getting the input data you're going to getting the input data you're going to perform data cleaning then there's perform data cleaning then there's perform data cleaning then there's exploratory data analysis followed by uh exploratory data analysis followed by uh exploratory data analysis followed by uh creating the model by using the machine creating the model by using the machine creating the model by using the machine learning algorithm and then this is learning algorithm and then this is learning algorithm and then this is followed by model evaluation and finally followed by model evaluation and finally followed by model evaluation and finally your predictions all right now one more your predictions all right now one more your predictions all right now one more thing to note here is that the output thing to note here is that the output thing to note here is that the output that you get by using supervised that you get by using supervised that you get by using supervised learning is also labeled output okay so learning is also labeled output okay so learning is also labeled output okay so basically you'll get two different basically you'll get two different basically you'll get two different classes of name Tom and one of name classes of name Tom and one of name classes of name Tom and one of name Jerry and you'll get them labeled that Jerry and you'll get them labeled that Jerry and you'll get them labeled that is how supervised Learning Works the is how supervised Learning Works the is how supervised Learning Works the most important thing in supervised most important thing in supervised most important thing in supervised learning is that you're training the learning is that you're training the learning is that you're training the model by using labeled data set right model by using labeled data set right model by using labeled data set right now now let's move on and look at now now let's move on and look at now now let's move on and look at unsupervised learning we look at the unsupervised learning we look at the unsupervised learning we look at the same example and understand how same example and understand how same example and understand how unsupervised learning works so what unsupervised learning works so what unsupervised learning works so what exactly is unsupervised learning now exactly is unsupervised learning now exactly is unsupervised learning now this involves training by using this involves training by using this involves training by using unlabeled data and allowing the model to unlabeled data and allowing the model to unlabeled data and allowing the model to act on that information without any act on that information without any act on that information without any guidance all right now like the name guidance all right now like the name guidance all right now like the name suggests itself there is no supervision suggests itself there is no supervision suggests itself there is no supervision here it's unsupervised learning so think here it's unsupervised learning so think here it's unsupervised learning so think of unsupervised learning as a smart kid of unsupervised learning as a smart kid of unsupervised learning as a smart kid that learns without any guidance okay in that learns without any guidance okay in that learns without any guidance okay in this type of machine machine learning this type of machine machine learning this type of machine machine learning the model is not fed with any label data the model is not fed with any label data the model is not fed with any label data as in the model has no clue that this is as in the model has no clue that this is as in the model has no clue that this is uh the image of Tom and this is Jerry uh the image of Tom and this is Jerry uh the image of Tom and this is Jerry right it figures out patterns and the right it figures out patterns and the right it figures out patterns and the differences between Tom and Jerry on its differences between Tom and Jerry on its differences between Tom and Jerry on its own by taking in tons and tons of data own by taking in tons and tons of data own by taking in tons and tons of data now how do you think the machine now how do you think the machine now how do you think the machine identifies this as Tom and then finally identifies this as Tom and then finally identifies this as Tom and then finally gives us the output like yes this is Tom gives us the output like yes this is Tom gives us the output like yes this is Tom this is Jerry for example it identifies this is Jerry for example it identifies this is Jerry for example it identifies prominent features of Tom such as pointy prominent features of Tom such as pointy prominent features of Tom such as pointy ears bigger in size and so on to ears bigger in size and so on to ears bigger in size and so on to understand that this image is of type understand that this image is of type understand that this image is of type one similarly it finds such features in one similarly it finds such features in one similarly it finds such features in Jerry and knows that this image is of Jerry and knows that this image is of Jerry and knows that this image is of type two meaning that the first image is type two meaning that the first image is type two meaning that the first image is different from the second image right so different from the second image right so different from the second image right so what the unsupervised learning uh what the unsupervised learning uh what the unsupervised learning uh algorithm or the model does is it'll algorithm or the model does is it'll algorithm or the model does is it'll form two different clusters it'll form form two different clusters it'll form form two different clusters it'll form one cluster which are very similar and one cluster which are very similar and one cluster which are very similar and the other cluster which is very the other cluster which is very the other cluster which is very different from the first cluster right different from the first cluster right different from the first cluster right that's how unsupervised learning works that's how unsupervised learning works that's how unsupervised learning works so the important things that you need to so the important things that you need to so the important things that you need to know in unsupervised learning is that know in unsupervised learning is that know in unsupervised learning is that you're going to feed the machine you're going to feed the machine you're going to feed the machine unlabeled data right the machine has to unlabeled data right the machine has to unlabeled data right the machine has to uh understand the patterns and discover uh understand the patterns and discover uh understand the patterns and discover the output on its own and finally the the output on its own and finally the the output on its own and finally the machine will form clusters based on machine will form clusters based on machine will form clusters based on feature similarity all right now let's feature similarity all right now let's feature similarity all right now let's move on and look at the last type of move on and look at the last type of move on and look at the last type of machine learning which is reinforcement machine learning which is reinforcement machine learning which is reinforcement learning reinforcement learning is quite learning reinforcement learning is quite learning reinforcement learning is quite different when compared to supervised different when compared to supervised different when compared to supervised and unsupervised learning right what and unsupervised learning right what and unsupervised learning right what exactly is reinforcement learning it is exactly is reinforcement learning it is exactly is reinforcement learning it is a part of of machine learning where an a part of of machine learning where an a part of of machine learning where an agent is put in an environment and he agent is put in an environment and he agent is put in an environment and he learns to behave in this environment by learns to behave in this environment by learns to behave in this environment by performing certain actions and observing performing certain actions and observing performing certain actions and observing the reward which it gets from those the reward which it gets from those the reward which it gets from those actions to understand what reinforcement actions to understand what reinforcement actions to understand what reinforcement learning is imagine that you were learning is imagine that you were learning is imagine that you were dropped off at an isolated island what dropped off at an isolated island what dropped off at an isolated island what would you do now Panic yes of course would you do now Panic yes of course would you do now Panic yes of course initially we'll all Panic But as time initially we'll all Panic But as time initially we'll all Panic But as time passes by you will learn how to live on passes by you will learn how to live on passes by you will learn how to live on the island you will explore the the island you will explore the the island you will explore the environment you will understand the environment you will understand the environment you will understand the climate conditions the type of food that climate conditions the type of food that climate conditions the type of food that grows there the dangers of the island grows there the dangers of the island grows there the dangers of the island and so on this is exactly how and so on this is exactly how and so on this is exactly how reinforcement learning works it reinforcement learning works it reinforcement learning works it basically involves an agent which is you basically involves an agent which is you basically involves an agent which is you stuck on the island that is put in an stuck on the island that is put in an stuck on the island that is put in an unknown environment which is the island unknown environment which is the island unknown environment which is the island where he must learn by observing and where he must learn by observing and where he must learn by observing and Performing actions that result in Performing actions that result in Performing actions that result in rewards all right so reinforcement rewards all right so reinforcement rewards all right so reinforcement learning is mainly used in advanced learning is mainly used in advanced learning is mainly used in advanced machine learning areas such as machine learning areas such as machine learning areas such as self-driving cars and alphago I'm sure a self-driving cars and alphago I'm sure a self-driving cars and alphago I'm sure a lot of you have heard of alphago right lot of you have heard of alphago right lot of you have heard of alphago right so the logic behind alphao is nothing so the logic behind alphao is nothing so the logic behind alphao is nothing but reinforcement learning and deep but reinforcement learning and deep but reinforcement learning and deep learning and in reinforcement learning learning and in reinforcement learning learning and in reinforcement learning there's not really any input data given there's not really any input data given there's not really any input data given to the agent all he has to do is he has to the agent all he has to do is he has to the agent all he has to do is he has to explore everything from scratch all to explore everything from scratch all to explore everything from scratch all right it's like a newborn baby with no right it's like a newborn baby with no right it's like a newborn baby with no information about anything he has to go information about anything he has to go information about anything he has to go around exploring the environment and you around exploring the environment and you around exploring the environment and you know getting rewards and Performing some know getting rewards and Performing some know getting rewards and Performing some actions which result in either Rewards actions which result in either Rewards actions which result in either Rewards or in some sort of punishment okay so or in some sort of punishment okay so or in some sort of punishment okay so that sums up the types of machine that sums up the types of machine that sums up the types of machine learning now before we move ahead I'd learning now before we move ahead I'd learning now before we move ahead I'd like to discuss the difference between like to discuss the difference between like to discuss the difference between the three types of machine learning just the three types of machine learning just the three types of machine learning just to make the concept clear to you all so to make the concept clear to you all so to make the concept clear to you all so let's start by looking at the let's start by looking at the let's start by looking at the definitions of each in supervised definitions of each in supervised definitions of each in supervised learning the machine will learn by using learning the machine will learn by using learning the machine will learn by using the label data in unsupervised learning the label data in unsupervised learning the label data in unsupervised learning there'll be unlabeled data and the there'll be unlabeled data and the there'll be unlabeled data and the Machine has to learn without any Machine has to learn without any Machine has to learn without any Supervision in reinforcement learning Supervision in reinforcement learning Supervision in reinforcement learning there'll be an agent which interacts there'll be an agent which interacts there'll be an agent which interacts with the environment by producing with the environment by producing with the environment by producing actions and discovers errors or rewards actions and discovers errors or rewards actions and discovers errors or rewards based on his actions right now what are based on his actions right now what are based on his actions right now what are the type of problems that can be solved the type of problems that can be solved the type of problems that can be solved by using supervised unsupervised and by using supervised unsupervised and by using supervised unsupervised and reinforcement learning when it comes to reinforcement learning when it comes to reinforcement learning when it comes to supervised learning the two main types supervised learning the two main types supervised learning the two main types of problems that are solved is of problems that are solved is of problems that are solved is regression problems and classification regression problems and classification regression problems and classification problems when it comes to unsupervised problems when it comes to unsupervised problems when it comes to unsupervised learning it is Association and learning it is Association and learning it is Association and clustering problems when it comes to clustering problems when it comes to clustering problems when it comes to reinforcement learning it's reward-based reinforcement learning it's reward-based reinforcement learning it's reward-based problems I'll be discussing regression problems I'll be discussing regression problems I'll be discussing regression classification clustering and all of classification clustering and all of classification clustering and all of this in the upcoming slides so don't this in the upcoming slides so don't this in the upcoming slides so don't worry if you don't understand this now worry if you don't understand this now worry if you don't understand this now the type of data with is used in the type of data with is used in the type of data with is used in supervised learning is labeled data in supervised learning is labeled data in supervised learning is labeled data in unsupervised learning it is unlabeled unsupervised learning it is unlabeled unsupervised learning it is unlabeled and in reinforcement learning we have no and in reinforcement learning we have no and in reinforcement learning we have no pre-defined data set right the agent has pre-defined data set right the agent has pre-defined data set right the agent has to do everything from scratch now the to do everything from scratch now the to do everything from scratch now the type of training involved in each of type of training involved in each of type of training involved in each of these learnings in supervised learning these learnings in supervised learning these learnings in supervised learning there is external supervision as in there is external supervision as in there is external supervision as in there is the label data set which acts there is the label data set which acts there is the label data set which acts as a guide for the machine to learn in as a guide for the machine to learn in as a guide for the machine to learn in unsupervised learning there's no unsupervised learning there's no unsupervised learning there's no supervision again in reinforcement supervision again in reinforcement supervision again in reinforcement learning there's no supervision at all learning there's no supervision at all learning there's no supervision at all Now what is is the approach to solve Now what is is the approach to solve Now what is is the approach to solve problems by using supervised problems by using supervised problems by using supervised unsupervised and reinforcement learning unsupervised and reinforcement learning unsupervised and reinforcement learning in supervised learning it is simple you in supervised learning it is simple you in supervised learning it is simple you have to map the labeled input to the have to map the labeled input to the have to map the labeled input to the known output right the machine knows known output right the machine knows known output right the machine knows what the output looks like so you're what the output looks like so you're what the output looks like so you're just labeling the input to the output in just labeling the input to the output in just labeling the input to the output in unsupervised learning you're going to unsupervised learning you're going to unsupervised learning you're going to understand the patterns and discover the understand the patterns and discover the understand the patterns and discover the output here you have no clue about what output here you have no clue about what output here you have no clue about what the input is right it's not labeled you the input is right it's not labeled you the input is right it's not labeled you just have to understand the patterns and just have to understand the patterns and just have to understand the patterns and you'll have to form clusters and you'll have to form clusters and you'll have to form clusters and discover the output in reinforcement discover the output in reinforcement discover the output in reinforcement learning there is no clue at all you'll learning there is no clue at all you'll learning there is no clue at all you'll have to follow the trial and error have to follow the trial and error have to follow the trial and error method right you'll have to go around method right you'll have to go around method right you'll have to go around your environment you'll have to explore your environment you'll have to explore your environment you'll have to explore the environment and you'll have to try the environment and you'll have to try the environment and you'll have to try some actions and only once you perform some actions and only once you perform some actions and only once you perform those actions you'll know that whether those actions you'll know that whether those actions you'll know that whether this is a reward based action or whether this is a reward based action or whether this is a reward based action or whether this is a punishment based action right this is a punishment based action right this is a punishment based action right so reinforcement learning is totally so reinforcement learning is totally so reinforcement learning is totally based on the concept of trial and error based on the concept of trial and error based on the concept of trial and error okay now popular algorithms under okay now

the be discussing these algorithms in the be discussing these algorithms in the upcoming slides right so let's move on upcoming slides right so let's move on upcoming slides right so let's move on and look at the next topic which is the and look at the next topic which is the and look at the next topic which is the types of problems solved using machine types of problems solved using machine types of problems solved using machine learning now this is what we were learning now this is what we were learning now this is what we were talking about earlier when I said talking about earlier when I said talking about earlier when I said regression classification and clustering regression classification and clustering regression classification and clustering problems okay so let's discuss what problems okay so let's discuss what problems okay so let's discuss what exactly I mean by that in machine exactly I mean by that in machine exactly I mean by that in machine learning all the problems can be learning all the problems can be learning all the problems can be classified into three types right every classified into three types right every classified into three types right every problem that is approached in machine problem that is approached in machine problem that is approached in machine learning can be put into one of these learning can be put into one of these learning can be put into one of these three categories okay so the first type three categories okay so the first type three categories okay so the first type is known as regression then we have is known as regression then we have is known as regression then we have classification and clustering so first classification and clustering so first classification and clustering so first let's look at regression type of let's look at regression type of let's look at regression type of problems so in this type of problem the problems so in this type of problem the problems so in this type of problem the output is all always a continuous output is all always a continuous output is all always a continuous quantity for example if you want to quantity for example if you want to quantity for example if you want to predict the speed of a car given the predict the speed of a car given the predict the speed of a car given the distance it is a regression problem now distance it is a regression problem now distance it is a regression problem now a lot of you might not be very aware of a lot of you might not be very aware of a lot of you might not be very aware of what exactly a continuous quantity is a what exactly a continuous quantity is a what exactly a continuous quantity is a continuous quantity is any quantity that continuous quantity is any quantity that continuous quantity is any quantity that can have an infinite range of values can have an infinite range of values can have an infinite range of values okay for example the weight of a person okay for example the weight of a person okay for example the weight of a person it is a continuous quantity because a it is a continuous quantity because a it is a continuous quantity because a weight can be 50 50.1 weight can be 50 50.1 weight can be 50 50.1 50.1 50.1 50.1 50.2 1 50.0 321 and so on it can have an 50.2 1 50.0 321 and so on it can have an 50.2 1 50.0 321 and so on it can have an infinite range of values correct so in infinite range of values correct so in infinite range of values correct so in the type of problem that you have to the type of problem that you have to the type of problem that you have to predict a continuous quantity you make predict a continuous quantity you make predict a continuous quantity you make use of regression algorithms all right use of regression algorithms all right use of regression algorithms all right so regression problems can be solved by so regression problems can be solved by so regression problems can be solved by using supervised learning algorithms using supervised learning algorithms using supervised learning algorithms like linear regression next we have like linear regression next we have like linear regression next we have classification now in this type of classification now in this type of classification now in this type of problems the output is always a problems the output is always a problems the output is always a categorical value now when I say categorical value now when I say categorical value now when I say categorical value it can be values such categorical value it can be values such categorical value it can be values such as the gender of a person is a as the gender of a person is a as the gender of a person is a categorical value okay now classifying categorical value okay now classifying categorical value okay now classifying emails into two classes like spam and emails into two classes like spam and emails into two classes like spam and non-spam is a classification problem non-spam is a classification problem non-spam is a classification problem that can be solved by using supervised that can be solved by using supervised that can be solved by using supervised learning classification algorithms like learning classification algorithms like learning classification algorithms like support Vector machines naive buys support Vector machines naive buys support Vector machines naive buys logistic regression kis neighbor and so logistic regression kis neighbor and so logistic regression kis neighbor and so on right so again the main aim in on right so again the main aim in on right so again the main aim in classification is to compute the classification is to compute the classification is to compute the category of the data right coming to category of the data right coming to category of the data right coming to clustering problems this time type of clustering problems this time type of clustering problems this time type of problem involves assigning the input problem involves assigning the input problem involves assigning the input into two or more clusters based on into two or more clusters based on into two or more clusters based on feature similarity now as soon as I read feature similarity now as soon as I read feature similarity now as soon as I read this sentence you should understand that this sentence you should understand that this sentence you should understand that this is unsupervised learning right this is unsupervised learning right this is unsupervised learning right because you don't have enough data about because you don't have enough data about because you don't have enough data about your input and the only option that you your input and the only option that you your input and the only option that you have is to form clusters right have is to form clusters right have is to form clusters right categories are formed only when you know categories are formed only when you know categories are formed only when you know that your data is of two type your input that your data is of two type your input that your data is of two type your input data is labeled and it's of two types so data is labeled and it's of two types so data is labeled and it's of two types so it's going to be a classification it's going to be a classification it's going to be a classification problem but when a clustering problem problem but when a clustering problem problem but when a clustering problem happens when you don't have much happens when you don't have much happens when you don't have much information about your input right all information about your input right all information about your input right all you have to do is you have to find you have to do is you have to find you have to do is you have to find patterns and you have to understand that patterns and you have to understand that patterns and you have to understand that data points which are similar are data points which are similar are data points which are similar are clustered into one group and data points clustered into one group and data points clustered into one group and data points which are different from the first group which are different from the first group which are different from the first group are clustered into another group right are clustered into another group right are clustered into another group right that's what clustering is an example is that's what clustering is an example is that's what clustering is an example is in Netflix what happens is Netflix in Netflix what happens is Netflix in Netflix what happens is Netflix clusters their users into similar groups clusters their users into similar groups clusters their users into similar groups based on their interest based on their based on their interest based on their based on their interest based on their age geography and so on right this can age geography and so on right this can age geography and so on right this can be done by using unsupervised wi be done by using unsupervised wi be done by using unsupervised wi learning algorithms like K means okay so learning algorithms like K means okay so learning algorithms like K means okay so guys those were the three categories of guys those were the three categories of guys those were the three categories of problems that can be solved by using problems that can be solved by using problems that can be solved by using machine learning so basically what I'm machine learning so basically what I'm machine learning so basically what I'm trying to say is all the problems will trying to say is all the problems will trying to say is all the problems will fall into one of these categories so any fall into one of these categories so any fall into one of these categories so any problem that you give to a machine problem that you give to a machine problem that you give to a machine learning model it'll fall into one of learning model it'll fall into one of learning model it'll fall into one of these categories okay now to make things these categories okay now to make things these categories okay now to make things a little more interesting I have a little more interesting I have a little more interesting I have collected

applicant based on his loan of an applicant based on his profile now what is your output variable profile now what is your output variable profile now what is your output variable over here your output variable is to over here your output variable is to over here your output variable is to predict whether you can approve the loan predict whether you can approve the loan predict whether you can approve the loan of a applicant or not so obviously your of a applicant or not so obviously your of a applicant or not so obviously your output is going to be categorical right output is going to be categorical right output is going to be categorical right it's either going to be yes or no no yes it's either going to be yes or no no yes it's either going to be yes or no no yes is basically approve loan no is reject is basically approve loan no is reject is basically approve loan no is reject loan right so here itself you understand loan right so here itself you understand loan right so

these are small examples of how you can use machine learning to solve clustering use machine learning to solve clustering use machine learning to solve clustering problems regression and classification problems regression and classification problems regression and classification problems the key is you need to identify problems the key is you need to identify problems the key is you need to identify the type of problem first right now the type of problem first right now the type of problem first right now let's move on and discuss the different let's move on and discuss the different let's move on and discuss the different types of machine learning types of machine learning types of machine learning algorithms right so we're going to start algorithms right so we're going to start algorithms right so we're going to start by discussing the different supervised by discussing the different supervised by discussing the different supervised learning algorithms so to give you a learning algorithms so to give you a learning algorithms so to give you a quick overview we'll be discussing the quick overview we'll be discussing the quick overview we'll be discussing the linear regression logistic regression linear regression logistic regression linear regression logistic regression decision tree random Forest naive Bas decision tree random Forest naive Bas decision tree random Forest naive Bas classifier support Vector machines and classifier support Vector machines and classifier support Vector machines and korus neighbor right we'll be discussing korus neighbor right we'll be discussing korus neighbor right we'll be discussing these seven algorithms so without any these seven algorithms so without any these seven algorithms so without any further delay let's look at linear further delay let's look at linear further delay let's look at linear regression first right now what exactly regression first right now what exactly regression first right now what exactly is a linear regression algorithm so guys is a linear regression algorithm so guys is a linear regression algorithm so guys linear regression is basically a linear regression is basically a linear regression is basically a supervised learning algorithm that is supervised learning algorithm that is supervised learning algorithm that is used to predict a continuous dependent used to predict a continuous dependent used to predict a continuous dependent variable y based on the values of variable y based on the values of variable y based on the values of independent variable X okay the independent variable X okay the independent variable X okay the important thing to note here is that the important thing to note here is that the important thing to note here is that the dependent variable y right the variable dependent variable y right the variable dependent variable y right the variable that you're trying to predict is always that you're trying to predict is always that you're trying to predict is always going to be a continuous variable but going to be a continuous variable but going to be a continuous variable but the independent variable X which is the independent variable X which is the independent variable X which is basically the predictor variables right basically the predictor variables right basically the predictor variables right these are the variables that you'll be these are the variables that you'll be these are the variables that you'll be using to predict your output variable using to predict your output variable using to predict your output variable which is nothing but your dep dependent which is nothing but your dep dependent which is nothing but your dep dependent variable so your independent variables variable so your independent variables variable so your independent variables or your predictor variables can either or your predictor variables can either or your predictor variables can either be continuous or discrete okay there is be continuous or discrete okay there is be continuous or discrete okay there is no such restriction over here okay they no such restriction over here okay they no such restriction over here okay they can be either continuous variables or can be either continuous variables or can be either continuous variables or they can be discrete variables now again they can be discrete variables now again they can be discrete variables now again I'll tell you what a continuous variable I'll tell you what a continuous variable I'll tell you what a continuous variable is in case you've forgotten it is a is in case you've forgotten it is a is in case you've forgotten it is a variable that has infinite number of variable that has infinite number of variable that has infinite number of possibilities so I give you an example possibilities so I give you an example possibilities so I give you an example of a person's weight right it can be 160 of a person's weight right it can be 160 of a person's weight right it can be 160 lb or they can weigh 16011 p pound or lb or they can weigh 16011 p pound or lb or they can weigh 16011 p pound or 16011 34b and so on right so the number 16011 34b and so on right so the number 16011 34b and so on right so the number of possibilities for weight is Limitless of possibilities for weight is Limitless of possibilities for weight is Limitless right and this is exactly what a right and this is exactly what a right and this is exactly what a continuous variable is now in order to continuous variable is now in order to continuous variable is now in order to understand linear regression let's understand linear regression let's understand linear regression let's assume that you want to predict the assume that you want to predict the assume that you want to predict the price of a stock over a period of time price of a stock over a period of time price of a stock over a period of time okay for such a problem you can make use okay for such a problem you can make use okay for such a problem you can make use of linear regression by studying the of linear regression by studying the of linear regression by studying the relationship between the dependent relationship between the dependent relationship between the dependent variable which is the stock price and variable which is the stock price and variable which is the stock price and the independent variable which is the the independent variable which is the the independent variable which is the time right you're trying to predict the time right you're trying to predict the time right you're trying to predict the stock price over a period of time so stock price over a period of time so stock price over a period of time so basically you're going to check how the basically you're going to check how the basically you're going to check how the price of a stock varies over a period of price of a stock varies over a period of price of a stock varies over a period of time so your stock price is going to be time so your stock price is going to be time so your stock price is going to be your dependent variable or your output your dependent variable or your output your dependent variable or your output variable and the time is going to be variable and the time is going to be variable and the time is going to be your predictor variable or your your predictor variable or your your predictor variable or your independent variable right let's not independent variable right let's not independent variable right let's not confuse it anymore your dependent confuse it anymore your dependent confuse it anymore your dependent variable is your output variable okay variable is your output variable okay variable is your output variable okay your independent variable is your input your independent variable is your input your independent variable is your input variable or your predictor variable variable or your predictor variable variable or your predictor variable right so in our case the stock price is right so in our case the stock price is right so in our case the stock price is obviously a continuous quantity because obviously a continuous quantity because obviously a continuous quantity because the stock price can have a infinite the stock price can have a infinite the stock price can have a infinite number of values right now the first number of values right now the first number of values right now the first step in linear regression is always to step in linear regression is always to step in linear regression is always to draw out a relationship between your draw out a relationship between your draw out a relationship between your dependent and your independent variable dependent and your independent variable dependent and your independent variable by using the best fitting linear line by using the best fitting linear line by using the best fitting linear line all right we make an assumption that all right we make an assumption that all right we make an assumption that your dependent and independent variable your dependent and independent variable your dependent and independent variable is linearly related to each other right is linearly related to each other right is linearly related to each other right we call it linear regression because we call it linear regression because we call it linear regression because both the variables vary linearly which both the variables vary linearly which both the variables vary linearly which means that while plotting the means that while plotting the means that while plotting the relationship between these two variables relationship between these two variables relationship between these two variables we'll get more of a straight line we'll get more of a straight line we'll get more of a straight line instead of a curve okay let's discuss instead of a curve okay let's discuss instead of a curve okay let's discuss the math behind linear regression so the math behind linear regression so the math behind linear regression so this equation of here it denotes the this equation of here it denotes the this equation of here it denotes the relationship between your independent relationship between your independent relationship between your independent variable X which is here and your variable X which is here and your variable X which is here and your dependent variable y right this is the dependent variable y right this is the dependent variable y right this is the variable you're trying to predict variable you're trying to predict variable you're trying to predict hopefully we all know that the equation hopefully we all know that the equation hopefully we all know that the equation for a linear line in math is y = to mx + for a linear line in math is y = to mx + for a linear line in math is y = to mx + C right I hope all of you remember math C right I hope all of you remember math C right I hope all of you remember math so the equation for a linear line in so the equation for a linear line in so the equation for a linear line in math is yal to MX plus C right similarly math is yal to MX plus C right similarly math is yal to MX plus C right similarly the linear regression equation is the linear regression equation is the linear regression equation is represented along the same line okay represented along the same line okay represented along the same line okay yals to MX plus C there's just a little yals to MX plus C there's just a little yals to MX plus C there's just a little bit of changes which I'll tell you what bit of changes which I'll tell you what bit of changes which I'll tell you what they are let's understand this equation they are let's understand this equation they are let's understand this equation properly all right so y basically stands properly all right so y basically stands properly all right so y basically stands for your dependent variable that you're for your dependent variable that you're for your dependent variable that you're going to predict okay B not is the Y Y going to predict okay B not is the Y Y going to predict okay B not is the Y Y intercept now Y intercept is nothing but intercept now Y intercept is nothing but intercept now Y intercept is nothing but this point here now in this graph you're this point here now in this graph you're this point here now in this graph you're basically showing the relationship basically showing the relationship basically showing the relationship between your dependent variable Y and between your dependent variable Y and between your dependent variable Y and your independent variable X now this is your independent variable X now this is your independent variable X now this is the linear relationship between these the linear relationship between these the linear relationship between these two variables okay now your Y intercept two variables okay now your Y intercept two variables okay now your Y intercept is basically the point on the line which is basically the point on the line which is basically the point on the line which touches the Y AIS right this is your Y touches the Y AIS right this is your Y touches the Y AIS right this is your Y intercept which is represented by B KN intercept which is represented by B KN intercept which is represented by B KN okay now B1 or beta is the slope of this okay now B1 or beta is the slope of this okay now B1 or beta is the slope of this line now the slope can either be line now the slope can either be line now the slope can either be negative or positive depending on the negative or positive depending on the negative or positive depending on the relationship between the dependent and relationship between the dependent and relationship between the dependent and independent variable the next variable independent variable the next variable independent variable the next variable that we have is X x here represents the that we have is X x here represents the that we have is X x here represents the independent variable that is used to independent variable that is used to independent variable that is used to predict our resultant output variable predict our resultant output variable predict our resultant output variable basically X is used to predict the value basically X is used to predict the value basically X is used to predict the value of y okay e here denotes the error in of y okay e here denotes the error in of y okay e here denotes the error in the computation right for example this the computation right for example this the computation right for example this is the actual line and these dots here is the actual line and these dots here is the actual line and these dots here represent the predicted values now the represent the predicted values now the represent the predicted values now the distance between these two is denoted by distance between these two is denoted by distance between these two is denoted by the error in the computation so this is the error in the computation so this is the error in the computation so this is the entire equation it's quite simple the entire equation it's quite simple the entire equation it's quite simple right linear regression will basically right linear regression will basically right linear regression will basically draw a relationship between your input draw a relationship between your input draw a relationship between your input and your output variable right that's and your output variable right that's and your output variable right that's how simple linear regression how simple linear regression how simple linear regression works now to better understand linear works now to better understand linear works now to better understand linear regression I'll be running a demo in regression I'll be running a demo in regression I'll be running a demo in Python so guys before I get started with Python so guys before I get started with Python so guys before I get started with our practical demo I'm assuming that our practical demo I'm assuming that our practical demo I'm assuming that most of you have a good understanding of most of you have a good understanding of most of you have a good understanding of python python python right because explaining python is going right because explaining python is going right because explaining python is going to be out of the scope of today's to be out of the scope of today's to be out of the scope of today's session but if some of you are not session but if some of you are not session but if some of you are not familiar with the Python language I'll familiar with the Python language I'll familiar with the Python language I'll leave a couple of links in the leave a couple of links in the leave a couple of links in the description box right those will be description box right those will be description box right those will be related to Python Programming you can go related to Python Programming you can go related to Python Programming you can go through those links understand Python through those links understand Python through those links understand Python and then maybe try to understand the and then maybe try to understand the and then maybe try to understand the demo but I'll be explaining the logic demo but I'll be explaining the logic demo but I'll be explaining the logic part of the demo in depth right so the part of the demo in depth right so the part of the demo in depth right so the main thing that we're going to do here main thing that we're going to do here main thing that we're going to do here is try and understand linear regression is try and understand linear regression is try and understand linear regression so it's okay if you do not understand so it's okay if you do not understand so it's okay if you do not understand python for now I'll try to explain as python for now I'll try to explain as python for now I'll try to explain as much as I can but if you still want to much as I can but if you still want to much as I can but if you still want to understand this in a better way I'll understand this in a better way I'll understand this in a better way I'll leave a couple of links in the leave a couple of links in the leave a couple of links in the description box you can go through those description box you can go through those description box you can go through those videos let me just zoom in for screen now in this linear regression screen now in this linear regression demo what we're going to do is we're demo what we're going to do is we're demo what we're going to do is we're going to form a linear relationship going to form a linear relationship going to form a linear relationship between the maxim temperature and between the maxim temperature and between the maxim temperature and minimum temperature on a particular day minimum temperature on a particular day minimum temperature on a particular day right which is going to do weather right which is going to do weather right which is going to do weather forecasting here so our task is to forecasting here so our task is to forecasting here so our task is to predict the maximum temperature taking predict the maximum temperature taking predict the maximum temperature taking input feature as minimum temperature so input feature as minimum temperature so input feature as minimum temperature so I'm just going to try and make you I'm just going to try and make you I'm just going to try and make you understand linear regression through understand linear regression through understand linear regression through this demo okay we'll see how it actually this demo okay we'll see how it actually this demo okay we'll see how it actually works practically now before I get works practically now before I get works practically now before I get started with the demo let me tell you started with the demo let me tell you started with the demo let me tell you something about the data set now our something about the data set now our something about the data set now our data set is uh stored in this path data set is uh stored in this path data set is uh stored in this path basically right the name of the data set basically right the name of the data set basically right the name of the data set is weather. CS is weather. CS is weather. CS SV okay now this contains uh data on SV okay now this contains uh data on SV okay now this contains uh data on weather conditions recorded on each day weather conditions recorded on each day weather conditions recorded on each day at various weather stations around the at various weather stations around the at various weather stations around the world okay the information includes world okay the information includes world okay the information includes precipitation snowfall temperatures wind precipitation snowfall temperatures wind precipitation snowfall temperatures wind speeds and whether the day included any speeds and whether the day included any speeds and whether the day included any thunderstorm or other poor weather thunderstorm or other poor weather thunderstorm or other poor weather conditions right so our first step in conditions right so our first step in conditions right so our first step in any demo for that matter will be to any demo for that matter will be to any demo for that matter will be to import all the libraries that are needed import all the libraries that are needed import all the libraries that are needed right so we're going to begin our uh right so we're going to begin our uh right so we're going to begin our uh demo by importing all all the required demo by importing all all the required demo by importing all all the required libraries after that we're going to read libraries after that we're going to read libraries after that we're going to read in our data right our data will be in our data right our data will be in our data right our data will be stored in this variable called data set stored in this variable called data set stored in this variable called data set and we're going to use a read. CSV and we're going to use a read. CSV and we're going to use a read. CSV function since our since our data set is function since our since our data set is function since our since our data set is in the CSV format right after that I'll in the CSV format right after that I'll in the CSV format right after that I'll be showing you how the data set looks be showing you how the data set looks be showing you how the data set looks right we'll also look at the data set in right we'll also look at the data set in right we'll also look at the data set in depth now let me just show you the depth now let me just show you the depth now let me just show you the output first right let's run this demo output first right let's run this demo output first right let's run this demo and see first all right we're getting a couple first all right we're getting a couple of plots which I'll talk about in a while so we can ignore this warning it while so we can ignore this warning it has nothing to do with so first of all has nothing to do with so first of all has nothing to do with so first of all uh we're printing the shape of our data uh we're printing the shape of our data uh we're printing the shape of our data set right so when we print the shape of set right so when we print the shape of set right so when we print the shape of our data set this is the output that we our data set this is the output that we our data set this is the output that we get so basically this shows that we have get so basically this shows that we have get so basically this shows that we have around 12,000 uh rows and 31 columns in around 12,000 uh rows and 31 columns in around 12,000 uh rows and 31 columns in our data set now the 31 columns our data set now the 31 columns our data set now the 31 columns basically represent the predictor basically represent the predictor basically represent the predictor variables so you can see that we have 31 variables so you can see that we have 31 variables so you can see that we have 31 predictor variables in order to predict predictor variables in order to predict predictor variables in order to predict the weather conditions on a particular the weather conditions on a particular the weather conditions on a particular dat so guys the main aim in this problem dat so guys the main aim in this problem dat so guys the main aim in this problem statement is weather forecasting we're statement is weather forecasting we're statement is weather forecasting we're going to predict the weather by using a going to predict the weather by using a going to predict the weather by using a set of predictor variables right so set of predictor variables right so set of predictor variables right so these are the different types of these are the different types of these are the different types of predictor variables that we have okay we predictor variables that we have okay we predictor variables that we have okay we have something known as maximum have something known as maximum have something known as maximum temperature so this is what our data set temperature so this is what our data set temperature so this is what our data set looks looks looks like now what I'm doing in this block of like now what I'm doing in this block of like now what I'm doing in this block of code is what we're doing is we're code is what we're doing is we're code is what we're doing is we're plotting our data points on a 2d graph plotting our data points on a 2d graph plotting our data points on a 2d graph in order to understand our data set and in order to understand our data set and in order to understand our data set and see if we can manually find any see if we can manually find any see if we can manually find any relationship between the variables here relationship between the variables here relationship between the variables here we've taken a minimum temperature and uh we've taken a minimum temperature and uh we've taken a minimum temperature and uh maximum temperature for doing our maximum temperature for doing our maximum temperature for doing our analysis so let's just look at this plot analysis so let's just look at this plot analysis so let's just look at this plot before that let me before that let me before that let me just comment all of these other plots so just comment all of these other plots so just comment all of these other plots so that you see only the graph that I'm that you see only the graph that I'm that you see only the graph that I'm talking about right so when you look at this graph right so when you look at this graph this is basically uh the graph between this is basically uh the graph between this is basically uh the graph between your minimum temperature and your your minimum temperature and your your minimum temperature and your maximum temperature maximum temperature maximum temperature maximum temperature maximum temperature maximum temperature is our dependent variable that we're is our dependent variable that we're is our dependent variable that we're going to predict right this is y and going to predict right this is y and going to predict right this is y and your minimum temperature is your X it's your minimum temperature is your X it's your minimum temperature is your X it's basically your independent variable so basically your independent variable so basically your independent variable so if you look at this graph you can see if you look at this graph you can see if you look at this graph you can see that there is a sort of linear that there is a sort of linear that there is a sort of linear relationship between the two except relationship between the two except relationship between the two except there are a little bit of outliers here there are a little bit of outliers here there are a little bit of outliers here and there right there are a few data and there right there are a few data and there right there are a few data points which are a little bit random but points which are a little bit random but points which are a little bit random but apart from that there is a pretty linear apart from that there is a pretty linear apart from that there is a pretty linear relationship between your minimum relationship between your minimum relationship between your minimum temperature and your maximum temperature temperature and your maximum temperature temperature and your maximum temperature all right so by this graph we can all right so by this graph we can all right so by this graph we can understand that you can easily solve understand that you can easily solve understand that you can easily solve this problem using linear regression this problem using linear regression this problem using linear regression right because our data is very linear I right because our data is very linear I right because our data is very linear I can see a clear straight line over here can see a clear straight line over here can see a clear straight line over here this is our first this is our first this is our first graph now next what I'm doing is I'm graph now next what I'm doing is I'm graph now next what I'm doing is I'm just checking the uh average maximum just checking the uh average maximum just checking the uh average maximum temperature that we have right I'm just temperature that we have right I'm just temperature that we have right I'm just looking at the average of our output looking at the average of our output looking at the average of our output variable okay so guys what we're doing variable okay so guys what we're doing variable okay so guys what we're doing here right now is just exploratory data here right now is just exploratory data here right now is just exploratory data analysis we're trying to understand our analysis we're trying to understand our analysis we're trying to understand our data we're trying to see you know the data we're trying to see you know the data we're trying to see you know the relationship between our input variable relationship between our input variable relationship between our input variable and our output variable we're trying to and our output variable we're trying to and our output variable we're trying to see the mean or the average of the see the mean or the average of the see the mean or the average of the output variable all of this is necessary output variable all of this is necessary output variable all of this is necessary to understand our data set so this is what our average maximum set so this is what our average maximum temperature looks like so if we try to temperature looks like so if we try to temperature looks like so if we try to understand where exactly this is so our understand where exactly this is so our understand where exactly this is so our average maximum temperature is somewhere average maximum temperature is somewhere average maximum temperature is somewhere between between between 28 and I would say between 30 right 28 28 and I would say between 30 right 28 28 and I would say between 30 right 28 and 32 somewhere there so you can say and 32 somewhere there so you can say and 32 somewhere there so you can say that our um average maximum temperature that our um average maximum temperature that our um average maximum temperature lies between 25 and 35 right so that is lies between 25 and 35 right so that is lies between 25 and 35 right so that is our average maximum temperature now that our average maximum temperature now that our average maximum temperature now that you know a little bit about the data set you know a little bit about the data set you know a little bit about the data set right you know that there's a very good right you know that there's a very good right you know that there's a very good linear relationship between your input linear relationship between your input linear relationship between your input variable and your output variable now variable and your output variable now variable and your output variable now what you're going to do is uh you're what you're going to do is uh you're what you're going to do is uh you're going to perform something known as data going to perform something known as data going to perform something known as data splicing let me just comment that for splicing let me just comment that for splicing let me just comment that for you this section is nothing but data you this section is nothing but data you this section is nothing but data splicing so for those of you who are splicing so for those of you who are splicing so for those of you who are paying attention know that data splicing paying attention know that data splicing paying attention know that data splicing is nothing but splitting your data set is nothing but splitting your data set is nothing but splitting your data set into training and testing data now into training and testing data now into training and testing data now before we do that I mentioned earlier before we do that I mentioned earlier before we do that I mentioned earlier that we'll be only using two variables that we'll be only using two variables that we'll be only using two variables over here because we're trying to over here because we're trying to over here because we're trying to understand the relationship between the understand the relationship between the understand the relationship between the minimum temperature and maximum minimum temperature and maximum minimum temperature and maximum temperature I'm doing this because I temperature I'm doing this because I temperature I'm doing this because I want you to understand linear regression want you to understand linear regression want you to understand linear regression in the simplest way possible so guys in in the simplest way possible so guys in in the simplest way possible so guys in order to make you understand linear order to make you understand linear order to make you understand linear regression I have just derived only two regression I have just derived only two regression I have just derived only two variables from our data set even though variables from our data set even though variables from our data set even though when we checked the structure of a data when we checked the structure of a data when we checked the structure of a data set we had around 31 features meaning set we had around 31 features meaning set we had around 31 features meaning that we had 31 variables which include that we had 31 variables which include that we had 31 variables which include my predictor variable and my target my predictor variable and my target my predictor variable and my target variable so basically we had 30 variable so basically we had 30 variable so basically we had 30 predictor variables and we had one predictor variables and we had one predictor variables and we had one target variable which is your maximum target variable which is your maximum target variable which is your maximum temperature right so what I'm doing here temperature right so what I'm doing here temperature right so what I'm doing here is I'm only considering these two is I'm only considering these two is I'm only considering these two variables because I want to show you variables because I want to show you variables because I want to show you exactly how linear regression works so exactly how linear regression works so exactly how linear regression works so here what I'm doing is I'm basically uh here what I'm doing is I'm basically uh here what I'm doing is I'm basically uh extracting only these two variables from extracting only these two variables from extracting only these two variables from our data set storing it in X and Y after our data set storing it in X and Y after our data set storing it in X and Y after that I'm performing data splicing so that I'm performing data splicing so that I'm performing data splicing so here I'm basically splitting the data here I'm basically splitting the data here I'm basically splitting the data into training and testing data and into training and testing data and into training and testing data and remember one point that I am assigning remember one point that I am assigning remember one point that I am assigning 20% of the data to our testing data set 20% of the data to our testing data set 20% of the data to our testing data set and the remaining 80% is assigned for and the remaining 80% is assigned for and the remaining 80% is assigned for training right that's how training works training right that's how training works training right that's how training works we assign maximum data set for training we assign maximum data set for training we assign maximum data set for training right we do this because we want the right we do this because we want the right we do this because we want the machine learning model or the machine machine learning model or the machine machine learning model or the machine learning algorithm to train better on learning algorithm to train better on learning algorithm to train better on data we wanted to take as much as data data we wanted to take as much as data data we wanted to take as much as data as possible so that it can predict the as possible so that it can predict the as possible so that it can predict the outcome properly right so to repeat it outcome properly right so to repeat it outcome properly right so to repeat it again for you so here we're just again for you so here we're just again for you so here we're just splitting the data into training and splitting the data into training and splitting the data into training and testing data set right so one more thing testing data set right so one more thing testing data set right so one more thing to note here is that we're splitting uh to note here is that we're splitting uh to note here is that we're splitting uh 80% of the data for training and we're 80% of the data for training and we're 80% of the data for training and we're assigning the 20% of the data to test assigning the 20% of the data to test assigning the 20% of the data to test data the test size variable this data the test size variable this data the test size variable this variable that you see is what is used to variable that you see is what is used to variable that you see is what is used to specify the proportion of the test set specify the proportion of the test set specify the proportion of the test set now after splitting the data into now after splitting the data into now after splitting the data into training and testing set finally the training and testing set finally the training and testing set finally the time is to train our algorithm for that time is to train our algorithm for that time is to train our algorithm for that we need to import the linear regression we need to import the linear regression we need to import the linear regression class we need to instantiate it and call class we need to instantiate it and call class we need to instantiate it and call the fit method along with our training the fit method along with our training the fit method along with our training data right this is our linear regression data right this is our linear regression data right this is our linear regression class and we just creating an instance class and we just creating an instance class and we just creating an instance of the linear regression class so guys a of the linear regression class so guys a of the linear regression class so guys a good thing about python is that you have good thing about python is that you have good thing about python is that you have predefined classes for your algorithms predefined classes for your algorithms predefined classes for your algorithms right you don't have to sit and code right you don't have to sit and code right you don't have to sit and code your algorithms instead all you have to your algorithms instead all you have to your algorithms instead all you have to do is you have to call this class linear do is you have to call this class linear do is you have to call this class linear regression class and you know you have regression class and you know you have regression class and you know you have to create an instance of it here I'm to create an instance of it here I'm to create an instance of it here I'm basically creating something known as a basically creating something known as a basically creating something known as a regressor and all you have to do is you regressor and all you have to do is you regressor and all you have to do is you have to call the fit method along with have to call the fit method along with have to call the fit method along with your training data right so this is my your training data right so this is my your training data right so this is my training data X train and Y train training data X train and Y train training data X train and Y train contains my training data and I'm contains my training data and I'm contains my training data and I'm calling our linear regression instance calling our linear regression instance calling our linear regression instance which is regressor along with this data which is regressor along with this data which is regressor along with this data set right so here here basically we are set right so here here basically we are set right so here here basically we are building the model we're doing nothing building the model we're doing nothing building the model we're doing nothing but building the model now one of the but building the model now one of the but building the model now one of the major things that a linear regression major things that a linear regression major things that a linear regression model does is it finds the best value model does is it finds the best value model does is it finds the best value for the intercept and the slope which for the intercept and the slope which for the intercept and the slope which results in a line that best fits the results in a line that best fits the results in a line that best fits the data right I discuss what intercept and data right I discuss what intercept and data right I discuss what intercept and slope is so if you want to see the slope is so if you want to see the slope is so if you want to see the intercept and the slope calculated by intercept and the slope calculated by intercept and the slope calculated by our linear regression model we just have our linear regression model we just have our linear regression model we just have to run this line of code right and let's to run this line of code right and let's to run this line of code right and let's look at the output for that right so our look at the output for that right so our look at the output for that right so our intercept is is around 10.66 and our intercept is is around 10.66 and our intercept is is around 10.66 and our coefficient or these are also known as coefficient or these are also known as coefficient or these are also known as beta coefficients coefficient is nothing beta coefficients coefficient is nothing beta coefficients coefficient is nothing but what we discussed beta not right but what we discussed beta not right but what we discussed beta not right these are beta values now this will just these are beta values now this will just these are beta values now this will just help you understand the significance of help you understand the significance of help you understand the significance of your input variables all right now what your input variables all right now what your input variables all right now what this coefficient value means is see the this coefficient value means is see the this coefficient value means is see the coefficient value is around 0.92 right coefficient value is around 0.92 right coefficient value is around 0.92 right this means that for every one unit this means that for every one unit this means that for every one unit change of your minimum temperature the change of your minimum temperature the change of your minimum temperature the change in the maximum temperature is change in the maximum temperature is change in the maximum temperature is around around around 0.92 right this will just show you how 0.92 right this will just show you how 0.92 right this will just show you how significant your input variable is right significant your input variable is right significant your input variable is right so for every one unit change in your so for every one unit change in your so for every one unit change in your minimum temperature the change in the minimum temperature the change in the minimum temperature the change in the maximum temperature will be around maximum temperature will be around maximum temperature will be around 0.92 all right I hope you have 0.92 all right I hope you have 0.92 all right I hope you have understood this part now that we've understood this part now that we've understood this part now that we've trained our algorithm it's time to make trained our algorithm it's time to make trained our algorithm it's time to make some predictions right to do so what some predictions right to do so what some predictions right to do so what we'll do is we'll use our test data set we'll do is we'll use our test data set we'll do is we'll use our test data set and we'll see how accurately our and we'll see how accurately our and we'll see how accurately our algorithm predicts the percentage score algorithm predicts the percentage score algorithm predicts the percentage score now to make prediction we have this line now to make prediction we have this line now to make prediction we have this line of code predict is basically a of code predict is basically a of code predict is basically a predefined function in Python and all predefined function in Python and all predefined function in Python and all you're going to do is you're going to you're going to do is you're going to you're going to do is you're going to pass your testing data set to this right pass your testing data set to this right pass your testing data set to this right now what you'll do is you'll compare the now what you'll do is you'll compare the now what you'll do is you'll compare the actual output values which is basically actual output values which is basically actual output values which is basically stored in your y test right and uh stored in your y test right and uh stored in your y test right and uh you'll compare these to the predicted you'll compare these to the predicted you'll compare these to the predicted values which is in y prediction all values which is in y prediction all values which is in y prediction all right and you'll store these comparisons right and you'll store these comparisons right and you'll store these comparisons in a data frame right called DF and all in a data frame right called DF and all in a data frame right called DF and all I'm doing here is I'm printing the data I'm doing here is I'm printing the data I'm doing here is I'm printing the data frame so if you look at the output this frame so if you look at the output this frame so if you look at the output this is what it looks like these are your is what it looks like these are your is what it looks like these are your actual values and these are the values actual values and these are the values actual values and these are the values that you predicted by building that that you predicted by building that that you predicted by building that model right so if your actual value is model right so if your actual value is model right so if your actual value is 28 you predicted around 33 here your 28 you predicted around 33 here your 28 you predicted around 33 here your actual value is 31 meaning that your actual value is 31 meaning that your actual value is 31 meaning that your maximum temperature is 31 and you maximum temperature is 31 and you maximum temperature is 31 and you predicted a maximum temperature of 30 predicted a maximum temperature of 30 predicted a maximum temperature of 30 now these values are actually pretty now these values are actually pretty now these values are actually pretty close right I feel like the accuracy is close right I feel like the accuracy is close right I feel like the accuracy is pretty good over here now in some cases pretty good over here now in some cases pretty good over here now in some cases you see a lot of variance like 23 here you see a lot of variance like 23 here you see a lot of variance like 23 here it's 15 right here it's 22 here it's 11 it's 15 right here it's 22 here it's 11 it's 15 right here it's 22 here it's 11 but such cases occur very often and the but such cases occur very often and the but such cases occur very often and the best way to improve your accuracy I best way to improve your accuracy I best way to improve your accuracy I would say is by training your model with would say is by training your model with would say is by training your model with more data all right you can also view more data all right you can also view more data all right you can also view this comparison in the form of a plot this comparison in the form of a plot this comparison in the form of a plot right let's see how that looks so basically this is a bar graph looks so basically this is a bar graph that shows our actual values and our that shows our actual values and our that shows our actual values and our predicted values blue is represented by predicted values blue is represented by predicted values blue is represented by your actual values and orange is your actual values and orange is your actual values and orange is represented by your predicted values at represented by your predicted values at represented by your predicted values at places you can see that we've predicted places you can see that we've predicted places you can see that we've predicted pretty well like the predictions are pretty well like the predictions are pretty well like the predictions are pretty close to the actual values in pretty close to the actual values in pretty close to the actual values in some cases the predictions are varying a some cases the predictions are varying a some cases the predictions are varying a little bit so in a few places it is little bit so in a few places it is little bit so in a few places it is actually varying but all of this depends actually varying but all of this depends actually varying but all of this depends on your input data as well when we saw on your input data as well when we saw on your input data as well when we saw the input data also we saw a lot of the input data also we saw a lot of the input data also we saw a lot of variation right we saw a couple of variation right we saw a couple of variation right we saw a couple of outliers so all that also might affect outliers so all that also might affect outliers so all that also might affect your output right but guys this is how your output right but guys this is how your output right but guys this is how you build machine learning models right you build machine learning models right you build machine learning models right initially you never going to get a initially you never going to get a initially you never going to get a really good accuracy what you have to do really good accuracy what you have to do really good accuracy what you have to do is you have to improve your training is you have to improve your training is you have to improve your training process that's the best way you can uh process that's the best way you can uh process that's the best way you can uh predict better right either you use a predict better right either you use a predict better right either you use a lot of data train your model with a lot lot of data train your model with a lot lot of data train your model with a lot of data or you use other methods like of data or you use other methods like of data or you use other methods like parameter tuning or basically you try parameter tuning or basically you try parameter tuning or basically you try and find another predictor variable that and find another predictor variable that and find another predictor variable that will help you more in predicting your will help you more in predicting your will help you more in predicting your output right to me this looks pretty output right to me this looks pretty output right to me this looks pretty good now let me show you another plot good now let me show you another plot good now let me show you another plot here what we're doing is we are uh here what we're doing is we are uh here what we're doing is we are uh drawing a straight line plot drawing a straight line plot drawing a straight line plot okay let's see how it looks so guys this trade line represents looks so guys this trade line represents a linear relationship now let's say you a linear relationship now let's say you a linear relationship now let's say you get a new data point okay let's say the get a new data point okay let's say the get a new data point okay let's say the value of x is around 20 so by using this value of x is around 20 so by using this value of x is around 20 so by using this line You can predict that for a minimum line You can predict that for a minimum line You can predict that for a minimum temperature of 20 your maximum temperature of 20 your maximum temperature of 20 your maximum temperature will be around 25 or temperature will be around 25 or temperature will be around 25 or something like that so we basically drew something like that so we basically drew something like that so we basically drew a linear relationship between our input a linear relationship between our input a linear relationship between our input and output variable over here now the and output variable over here now the and output variable over here now the final step is to evaluate the final step is to evaluate the final step is to evaluate the performance of the algorithm right this performance of the algorithm right this performance of the algorithm right this step is particularly important to step is particularly important to step is particularly important to compare how well different algorithms compare how well different algorithms compare how well different algorithms perform on a particular data set now for perform on a particular data set now for perform on a particular data set now for regression algorithms three evaluation regression algorithms three evaluation regression algorithms three evaluation metrics are used we have something known metrics are used we have something known metrics are used we have something known as mean absolute error mean squared as mean absolute error mean squared as mean absolute error mean squared error and root mean squared error now error and root mean squared error now error and root mean squared error now mean absolute error is nothing but the mean absolute error is nothing but the mean absolute error is nothing but the absolute value of the errors right your absolute value of the errors right your absolute value of the errors right your mean squared error is a mean of the mean squared error is a mean of the mean squared error is a mean of the squared errors that's all it's basically squared errors that's all it's basically squared errors that's all it's basically you read this and you understand what you read this and you understand what you read this and you understand what the error means your root mean squared the error means your root mean squared the error means your root mean squared error is the square root of the mean of error is the square root of the mean of error is the square root of the

pretty simple to understand your mean absolute error your mean squared mean absolute error your mean squared mean absolute error your mean squared error your root mean squared error right error your root mean squared error right error your root mean squared error right now luckily we don't have to perform now luckily we don't have to perform now luckily we don't have to perform these calculations manually right we these calculations manually right we these calculations manually right we don't have to code each of these don't have to code each of these don't have to code each of these calculations the the cycle learn Library calculations the the cycle learn Library calculations the the cycle learn Library comes with a pre-built functions that comes with a pre-built functions that comes with a pre-built functions that can be used to find out these values can be used to find out these values can be used to find out these values Okay so when you run this code you'll Okay so when you run this code you'll Okay so when you run this code you'll get these values for each of the errors get these values for each of the errors get these values for each of the errors right you'll get around 3.19 as the mean right you'll get around 3.19 as the mean right you'll get around 3.19 as the mean absolute error your mean squared error absolute error your mean squared error absolute error your mean squared error is around is around is around 17.63 your root mean squared error is 17.63 your root mean squared error is 17.63 your root mean squared error is around around around 4.19 now these error values basically 4.19 now these error values basically 4.19 now these error values basically show that our module accuracy is not show that our module accuracy is not show that our module accuracy is not very precise right but it's still able very precise right but it's still able very precise right but it's still able to make a lot of predictions right we to make a lot of predictions right we to make a lot of predictions right we can draw a good linear relationship now can draw a good linear relationship now can draw a good linear relationship now in order to improve the efficiency I in order to improve the efficiency I in order to improve the efficiency I told you all there are a lot of methods told you all there are a lot of methods told you all there are a lot of methods like this par parameter tuning and all like this par parameter tuning and all like this par parameter tuning and all of that or basically you can train your of that or basically you can train your of that or basically you can train your model with a lot more data apart from model with a lot more data apart from model with a lot more data apart from that you can use other predictor that you can use other predictor that you can use other predictor variables or maybe you can study the variables or maybe you can study the variables or maybe you can study the relationship between other

improve the efficiency of the model but for now I just wanted to make model but for now I just wanted to make model but for now I just wanted to make you understand how linear regression you understand how linear regression you understand how linear regression works and I hope all of you have a good works and I hope all of you have a good works and I hope all of you have a good idea about this right I hope all of you idea about this right I hope all of you idea about this right I hope all of you have a good understanding of how uh have a good understanding of how uh have a good understanding of how uh linear regression works right this was a linear regression works right this was a linear regression works right this was a small demo about it so if any of you small demo about it so if any of you small demo about it so if any of you still have any doubts regarding linear still have any doubts regarding linear still have any doubts regarding linear regression please leave that in the regression please leave that in the regression please leave that in the comment section right we'll try and comment section right we'll try and comment section right we'll try and solve all your errors so if you look at solve all your errors so if you look at solve all your errors so if you look at this equation we calculated everything this equation we calculated everything this equation we calculated everything here right we drew a relationship here right we drew a relationship here right we drew a relationship between Y and X which is basically X was between Y and X which is basically X was between Y and X which is basically X was our minimum temperature y was our our minimum temperature y was our our minimum temperature y was our maximum temperature we also calculated maximum temperature we also calculated maximum temperature we also calculated the slope and The Intercept right and we the slope and The Intercept right and we the slope and The Intercept right and we also calculated the error in the end we also calculated the error in the end we also calculated the error in the end we calculated mean squared error we calculated mean squared error we calculated mean squared error we calculated the root mean Square error we calculated the root mean Square error we calculated the root mean Square error we also calculated the mean absolute error also calculated the mean absolute error also calculated the mean absolute error right so that was everything about right so that was everything about right so that was everything about linear regression this was a simple linear regression this was a simple linear regression this was a simple linear regression model right now let's linear regression model right now let's linear regression model right now let's move on and look at our next algorithm move on and look at our next algorithm move on and look at our next algorithm which is logistic which is logistic which is logistic regression now in order to understand regression now in order to understand regression now in order to understand why we use logistic regression let's why we use logistic regression let's why we use logistic regression let's consider a small scenario all right consider a small scenario all right consider a small scenario all right let's say that your little sister is let's say that your little sister is let's say that your little sister is trying to get into grad school and you trying to get into grad school and you trying to get into grad school and you want to predict whether she'll get want to predict whether she'll get want to predict whether she'll get admitted in Her Dream school or or not admitted in Her Dream school or or not admitted in Her Dream school or or not okay so based on her cgpa and the pass okay so based on her cgpa and the pass okay so based on her cgpa and the pass data you can use logistic regression to data you can use logistic regression to data you can use logistic regression to foresee the outcome right so logistic foresee the outcome right so logistic foresee the outcome right so logistic regression will allow you to analyze a regression will allow you to analyze a regression will allow you to analyze a set of variables and predict a set of variables and predict a set of variables and predict a categorical outcome since here we need categorical outcome since here we need categorical outcome since here we need to predict whether she will uh get into to predict whether she will uh get into to predict whether she will uh get into a school or not which is a a school or not which is a a school or not which is a classification problem logistic classification problem logistic classification problem logistic regression will be used now I know the regression will be used now I know the regression will be used now I know the first question in your head is why are first question in your head is why are first question in your head is why are we not using linear regression in this we not using linear regression in this we not using linear regression in this case the reason is that linear case the reason is that linear case the reason is that linear regression is used to predict a regression is used to predict a regression is used to predict a continuous quantity rather than a continuous quantity rather than a continuous quantity rather than a categorical one here we're going to categorical one here we're going to categorical one here we're going to predict whether or not your sister is predict whether or not your sister is predict whether or not your sister is going to get into grad school right so going to get into grad school right so going to get into grad school right so that is clearly a categorical outcome so that is clearly a categorical outcome so that is clearly a categorical outcome so when the resultant outcome can take only when the resultant outcome can take only when the resultant outcome can take only classes of values like two classes of classes of values like two classes of classes of values like two classes of values it is sensible to have a model values it is sensible to have a model values it is sensible to have a model that predicts the value as either zero that predicts the value as either zero that predicts the value as either zero or one or in a probability form that or one or in a probability form that or one or in a probability form that ranges between 0er and 1 okay so linear ranges between 0er and 1 okay so linear ranges between 0er and 1 okay so linear regression does not have this ability if regression does not have this ability if regression does not have this ability if you use linear regression to model a you use linear regression to model a you use linear regression to model a binary outcome the resulting model will binary outcome the resulting model will binary outcome the resulting model will not predict y values in the range of 0o not predict y values in the range of 0o not predict y values in the range of 0o and one right because linear regression and one right because linear regression and one right because linear regression works on continuous dependent variables works on continuous dependent variables works on continuous dependent variables and not on categorical variables that's and not on categorical variables that's and not on categorical variables that's why we make use of logistic regression why we make use of logistic regression why we make use of logistic regression so understand that linear regression was so understand that linear regression was so understand that linear regression was used to predict continuous quantities used to predict continuous quantities used to predict continuous quantities and logistic regression is used to and logistic regression is used to and logistic regression is used to predict categorical quantities okay now predict categorical quantities okay now predict categorical quantities okay now one major confusion that everybody has one major confusion that everybody has one major confusion that everybody has is people keep asking me why is logistic is people keep asking me why is logistic is people keep asking me why is logistic regression called logistic regression regression called logistic regression regression called logistic regression when it is used for classification the when it is used for classification the when it is used for classification the reason it is named logistic regression reason it is named logistic regression reason it is named logistic regression is because its primary technique is very is because its primary technique is very is because its primary technique is very similar to linear regression okay similar to linear regression okay similar to linear regression okay there's no other reason behind the there's no other reason behind the there's no other reason behind the naming it belongs to the general linear naming it belongs to the general linear naming it belongs to the general linear models okay it belongs to the same class models okay it belongs to the same class models okay it belongs to the same class as linear regression but there's no as linear regression but there's no as linear regression but there's no other reason behind the name logistic other reason behind the name logistic other reason behind the name logistic regression logistic regression is mainly regression logistic regression is mainly regression logistic regression is mainly used for classification purpose because used for classification purpose because used for classification purpose because here you'll have to predict a dependent here you'll have to predict a dependent here you'll have to predict a dependent variable which is categorical in nature variable which is categorical in nature variable which is categorical in nature right so this is mainly used for right so this is mainly used for right so this is mainly used for classification so to Define logistic classification so to Define logistic classification so to Define logistic regression for you logistic regression regression for you logistic regression regression for you logistic regression is a method used to predict a dependent is a method used to predict a dependent is a method used to predict a dependent variable y given an independent variable variable y given an independent variable variable y given an independent variable X such that the dependent variable is X such that the dependent variable is X such that the dependent variable is categorical meaning that your output is categorical meaning that your output is categorical meaning that your output is a categorical variable so obviously this a categorical variable so obviously this a categorical variable so obviously this is a classification algorithm so guys is a classification algorithm so guys is a classification algorithm so guys again to clear your confusion when I say again to clear your confusion when I say again to clear your confusion when I say categorical variable I mean that it can categorical variable I mean that it can categorical variable I mean that it can hold values like 1 or zero yes or no hold values like 1 or zero yes or no hold values like 1 or zero yes or no true or false and so on right so true or false and so on right so true or false and so on right so basically in logistic regression the basically in logistic regression the basically in logistic regression the outcome is always outcome is always outcome is always categorical now how does logistic categorical now how does logistic categorical now how does logistic regression work so guys before I tell regression work so guys before I tell regression work so guys before I tell you how logistic regression Works take a you how logistic regression Works take a you how logistic regression Works take a look at this graph now I told you that look at this graph now I told you that look at this graph now I told you that the outcome in a logistic regression is the outcome in a logistic regression is the outcome in a logistic regression is categorical right your outcome will categorical right your outcome will categorical right your outcome will either be zero or one or it'll be a either be zero or one or it'll be a either be zero or one or it'll be a probability that ranges between 0o and probability that ranges between 0o and probability that ranges between 0o and one so that's why we have this S curve one so that's why we have this S curve one so that's why we have this S curve now some of you might think that why do now some of you might think that why do now some of you might think that why do we have an S curve right we can't we have an S curve right we can't we have an S curve right we can't obviously have a straight line we have obviously have a straight line we have obviously have a straight line we have something known as a sigmoid curve something known as a sigmoid curve something known as a sigmoid curve because we can have values ranging because we can have values ranging because we can have values ranging between 0er and one which will basically between 0er and one which will basically between 0er and one which will basically show the probability so maybe your show the probability so maybe your show the probability so maybe your output will be output will be output will be 0.7 right which is a probability value 0.7 right which is a probability value 0.7 right which is a probability value if it is 0.7 it means that your outcome if it is 0.7 it means that your outcome if it is 0.7 it means that your outcome is basically one so that's why we have is basically one so that's why we have is basically one so that's why we have this sigmoid curve like this okay now this sigmoid curve like this okay now this sigmoid curve like this okay now I'll explain more about this in depth in I'll explain more about this in depth in I'll explain more about this in depth in a while now in order to understand how a while now in order to understand how a while now in order to understand how logistic regression works first let's logistic regression works first let's logistic regression works first let's take a look at the linear regression take a look at the linear regression take a look at the linear regression equation right this was the linear equation right this was the linear equation right this was the linear regression equation that we discussed y regression equation that we discussed y regression equation that we discussed y here stands for the dependent variable here stands for the dependent variable here stands for the dependent variable that needs to be predicted beta KN is that needs to be predicted beta KN is that needs to be predicted beta KN is nothing but the Y intercept beta 1 is nothing but the Y intercept beta 1 is nothing but the Y intercept beta 1 is nothing but the slope and X represents nothing but the slope and X represents nothing but the slope and X represents the independent variable that is used to the independent variable that is used to the independent variable that is used to predict y right e denotes the error in predict y right e denotes the error in predict y right e denotes the error in the computation so given the fact that X the computation so given the fact that X the computation so given the fact that X is the independent variable and Y is the is the independent variable and Y is the is the independent variable and Y is the dependent variable how can we represent dependent variable how can we represent dependent variable how can we represent a relationship between X and Y such that a relationship between X and Y such that a relationship between X and Y such that y ranges only between 0 and 1 here this y ranges only between 0 and 1 here this y ranges only between 0 and 1 here this value basically denotes probability of y value basically denotes probability of y value basically denotes probability of y equal to 1 given some value of x so here equal to 1 given some value of x so here equal to 1 given some value of x so here basically this PR denotes probability basically this PR denotes probability basically this PR denotes probability and this value basically denotes that and this value basically denotes that and this value basically denotes that the probability of y equal to 1 given the probability of y equal to 1 given the probability of y equal to 1 given some value of x right this is what we some value of x right this is what we some value of x right this is what we need to find out now if you want to need to find out now if you want to need to find out now if you want to calculate the probability using the calculate the probability using the calculate the probability using the linear regression model then the linear regression model then the linear regression model then the probability will look something like P probability will look something like P probability will look something like P of x equal to Beta plus beta 1 into X of x equal to Beta plus beta 1 into X of x equal to Beta plus beta 1 into X right P of X will be equal to Beta plus right P of X will be equal to Beta plus right P of X will be equal to Beta plus beta 1 into X where P of X is nothing beta 1 into X where P of X is nothing beta 1 into X where P of X is nothing but your probability of getting y equal but your probability of getting y equal but your probability of getting y equal to 1 given some value of x so the to 1 given some value of x so the to 1 given some value of x so the logistic regression equation is derived logistic regression equation is derived logistic regression equation is derived from the same equation except we need to from the same equation except we need to from the same equation except we need to make a few alterations because the make a few alterations because the make a few alterations because the output is only categorical all right so output is only categorical all right so output is only categorical all right so logistic regression does not necessarily logistic regression does not necessarily logistic regression does not necessarily calculate the outcome as zero or one calculate the outcome as zero or one calculate the outcome as zero or one right I mentioned this before only right I mentioned this before only right I mentioned this before only instead it calculates the probability of instead it calculates the probability of instead it calculates the probability of a variable falling in the class zero or a variable falling in the class zero or a variable falling in the class zero or class one so that's why we can conclude class one so that's why we can conclude class one so that's why we can conclude that the resultant variable must must be that the resultant variable must must be that the resultant variable must must be positive and it should lie between 0 and positive and it should lie between 0 and positive and it should lie between 0 and 1 which means that it must be less than 1 which means that it must be less than 1 which means that it must be less than one right so to meet these conditions we one right so to meet these conditions we one right so to meet these conditions we have to do two things first we can take have to do two things first we can take have to do two things first we can take the exponent of the equation because the exponent of the equation because the exponent of the equation because taking an exponential of any value will taking an exponential of any value will taking an exponential of any value will make sure that you get a positive number make sure that you get a positive number make sure that you get a positive number correct secondly you have to make sure correct secondly you have to make sure correct secondly you have to make sure that your output is less than one right that your output is less than one right that your output is less than one right so a number divided by itself + one will so a number divided by itself + one will so a number divided by itself + one will always be less than one so that's how we always be less than one so that's how we always be less than one so that's how we get this formula First We Take the get this formula First We Take the get this formula First We Take the exponent of the equation beta + beta 1 + exponent of the equation beta + beta 1 + exponent of the equation beta + beta 1 + x and then we divide it by that number x and then we divide it by that number x and then we divide it by that number plus one so this is how we get this plus one so this is how we get this plus one so this is how we get this formula now the next step is to formula now the next step is to formula now the next step is to calculate something known as the logit calculate something known as the logit calculate something known as the logit function now the logic function is function now the logic function is function now the logic function is nothing but it is a link function that nothing but it is a link function that nothing but it is a link function that is represented as an S curve or as a is represented as an S curve or as a is represented as an S curve or as a sigmoid curve that ranges between the sigmoid curve that ranges between the sigmoid curve that ranges between the Valu 0 and 1 right it basically Valu 0 and 1 right it basically Valu 0 and 1 right it basically calculates the probability of the output calculates the probability of the output calculates the probability of the output variable so if you look at this equation variable so if you look at this equation variable so if you look at this equation it's quite simple what we have done here it's quite simple what we have done here it's quite simple what we have done here is we just cross multiply and take e to is we just cross multiply and take e to is we just cross multiply and take e to the^ Beta plus beta 1 into X as common the^ Beta plus beta 1 into X as common the^ Beta plus beta 1 into X as common right the rhs denotes the linear right the rhs denotes the linear right the rhs denotes the linear equation for the independent variables equation for the independent variables equation for the independent variables the LHS represents the odd ratio so if the LHS represents the odd ratio so if the LHS represents the odd ratio so if you compute this entire thing you'll get you compute this entire thing you'll get you compute this entire thing you'll get this final value which is basically your this final value which is basically your this final value which is basically your logistic regression equation your rhs logistic regression equation your rhs logistic regression equation your rhs here denotes the linear equation for here denotes the linear equation for here denotes the linear equation for independent variables and your LHS independent variables and your LHS independent variables and your LHS represents the odd ratio which is also represents the odd ratio which is also represents the odd ratio which is also known as the logit function so I told known as the logit function so I told known as the logit function so I told you that logit function is basically a you that logit function is basically a you that logit function is basically a function that represents an S curve that function that represents an S curve that function that represents an S curve that ranges between 0 and one right this will ranges between 0 and one right this will ranges between 0 and one right this will make sure that our value ranges between make sure that our value ranges between make sure that our value ranges between 0 and one so in logistic regression on 0 and one so in logistic regression on 0 and one so in logistic regression on increasing this x by one measure it increasing this x by one measure it increasing this x by one measure it changes the loged by a factor of beta KN changes the loged by a factor of beta KN changes the loged by a factor of beta KN is the same thing as I showed you in is the same thing as I showed you in is the same thing as I showed you in linear regression so guys that's how you linear regression so guys that's how you linear regression so guys that's how you derive the logistic regression equation derive the logistic regression equation derive the logistic regression equation so if you have any doubts regarding so if you have any doubts regarding so if you have any doubts regarding these equations please leave them in the these equations please leave them in the these equations please leave them in the comment section and I'll get back to you comment section and I'll get back to you comment section and I'll get back to you and I'll clear the doubts right so to and I'll clear the doubts right so to and I'll clear the doubts right so to Summit up logistic regression is used Summit up logistic regression is used Summit up logistic regression is used for classification the output variable for classification the output variable for classification the output variable will always be a categorical variable we will always be a categorical variable we will always be a categorical variable we also saw how you derived at the logistic also saw how you derived at the logistic also saw how you derived at the logistic regression equation right and one more regression equation right and one more regression equation right and one more important thing is that the relationship important thing is that the relationship important thing is that the relationship between the variables in a logistic between the variables in a logistic between the variables in a logistic regression is denoted as an S curve regression is denoted as an S curve regression is denoted as an S curve which is also known as a sigmoid curve which is also known as a sigmoid curve which is also known as a sigmoid curve and also the outcome does not and also the outcome does not and also the outcome does not necessarily have to be calculated as necessarily have to be calculated as necessarily have to be calculated as zero or one it can be calculated as a zero or one it can be calculated as a zero or one it can be calculated as a probability that the output lies in probability that the output lies in probability that the output lies in class one or class zero right so your class one or class zero right so your class one or class zero right so your output can be a probability ranging output can be a probability ranging output can be a probability ranging between 0o and one that's why we have a between 0o and one that's why we have a between 0o and one that's why we have a Sig moint curve so I hope all of you are Sig moint curve so I hope all of you are Sig moint curve so I hope all of you are clear with logistic regression now uh I clear with logistic regression now uh I clear with logistic regression now uh I won't be showing you the demo right away won't be showing you the demo right away won't be showing you the demo right away I'll explain a couple of more I'll explain a couple of more I'll explain a couple of more classification algorithms then I'll show classification algorithms then I'll show classification algorithms then I'll show you a practical demo where we'll use you a practical demo where we'll use you a practical demo where we'll use multiple classification algorithms to multiple classification algorithms to multiple classification algorithms to solve the same problem okay and we'll solve the same problem okay and we'll solve the same problem okay and we'll also calculate the accuracy and see also calculate the accuracy and see also calculate the accuracy and see which classification algorithm is doing which classification algorithm is doing which classification algorithm is doing the best now the next algorithm I'm the best now the next algorithm I'm the best now the next algorithm I'm going to talk about is decision tree going to talk about is decision tree going to talk about is decision tree decision tree is one of my favorite decision tree is one of my favorite decision tree is one of my favorite algorithms because it's very simple to algorithms because it's very simple to algorithms because it's very simple to understand how a decision tree works so understand how a decision tree works so understand how a decision tree works so guys uh before this we discussed linear guys uh before this we discussed linear guys uh before this we discussed linear regression which is a regression regression which is a regression regression which is a regression algorithm then we discuss logistic algorithm then we discuss logistic algorithm then we discuss logistic regression which is a classification regression which is a classification regression which is a classification algorithm remember don't get confused algorithm remember don't get confused algorithm remember don't get confused just because it has the name logistic just because it has the name logistic just because it has the name logistic regression okay it is a classification regression okay it is a classification regression okay it is a classification algorithm now we discussing decision algorithm now we discussing decision algorithm now we discussing decision tree which is again a classification tree which is again a classification tree which is again a classification algorithm okay so what exactly is a algorithm okay so what exactly is a algorithm okay so what exactly is a decision tree now a decision tree is decision tree now a decision tree is decision tree now a decision tree is again a supervised machine learning again a supervised machine learning again a supervised machine learning algorithm which looks like an inverted algorithm which looks like an inverted algorithm which looks like an inverted tree where in each node represents a tree where in each node represents a tree where in each node represents a predictor variable and the link between predictor variable and the link between predictor variable and the link between the node represents a decision and each the node represents a decision and each the node represents a decision and each Leaf node represents an outcome now I Leaf node represents an outcome now I Leaf node represents an outcome now I know that's a little confusing so let me know that's a little confusing so let me know that's a little confusing so let me make you understand what a decision tree make you understand what a decision tree make you understand what a decision tree is with the help of an example let's say is with the help of an example let's say is with the help of an example let's say that you hosted a huge party and you that you hosted a huge party and you that you hosted a huge party and you want to know how many of your guests are want to know how many of your guests are want to know how many of your guests are nonvegetarians so to solve this problem nonvegetarians so to solve this problem nonvegetarians so to solve this problem you can create a simple decision tree you can create a simple decision tree you can create a simple decision tree now if you look at this figure over here now if you look at this figure over here now if you look at this figure over here I've created a decision tree that I've created a decision tree that I've created a decision tree that classifies a guest as either vegetarian classifies a guest as either vegetarian classifies a guest as either vegetarian or nonvegetarian right our last outcome or nonvegetarian right our last outcome or nonvegetarian right our last outcome here is nonv or veg right so here only here is nonv or veg right so here only here is nonv or veg right so here only you understand that this is a you understand that this is a you understand that this is a classification algorithm because here classification algorithm because here classification algorithm because here you're predicting a categorical value you're predicting a categorical value you're predicting a categorical value each node over here represents a each node over here represents a each node over here represents a predictor variable so eat chicken is one predictor variable so eat chicken is one predictor variable so eat chicken is one variable eat mutton is one variable variable eat mutton is one variable variable eat mutton is one variable Seafood is another variable right so Seafood is another variable right so Seafood is another variable right so each node represents a predictor each node represents a predictor each node represents a predictor variable that will help you conclude variable that will help you conclude variable that will help you conclude whether or not a guest is a whether or not a guest is a whether or not a guest is a non-vegetarian now as you Traverse down non-vegetarian now as you Traverse down non-vegetarian now as you Traverse down the tree you'll make decisions at each the tree you'll make decisions at each the tree you'll make decisions at each node until you reach the dead end node until you reach the dead end node until you reach the dead end okay that's how it works so let's say we okay that's how it works so let's say we okay that's how it works so let's say we got a new data point now we'll pass it got a new data point now we'll pass it got a new data point now we'll pass it through the decision tree the first through the decision tree the first through the decision tree the first variable is did the guest eat the variable is did the guest eat the variable is did the guest eat the chicken if yes then he's a chicken if yes then he's a chicken if yes then he's a non-vegetarian if no then you'll pass it non-vegetarian if no then you'll pass it non-vegetarian if no then you'll pass it to the next variable which is did the to the next variable which is did the to the next variable which is did the guest eat mutton if yes then he's a guest eat mutton if yes then he's a guest eat mutton if yes then he's a non-vegetarian if no then you'll pass it non-vegetarian if no then you'll pass it non-vegetarian if no then you'll pass it to the next variable which is seafood if to the next variable which is seafood if to the next variable which is seafood if he ate Seafood then he is a he ate Seafood then he is a he ate Seafood then he is a nonvegetarian if no then he's a nonvegetarian if no then he's a nonvegetarian if no then he's a vegetarian right this is how a decision vegetarian right this is how a decision vegetarian right this is how a decision tree works it's a very simple algorithm tree works it's a very simple algorithm tree works it's a very simple algorithm that you can easily understand right it that you can easily understand right it that you can easily understand right it is drawn out like this which is very is drawn out like this which is very is drawn out like this which is very easy to understand now let's understand easy to understand now let's understand easy to understand now let's understand the structure of a decision tree I just the structure of a decision tree I just the structure of a decision tree I just showed you an example of how the showed you an example of how the showed you an example of how the decision tree works now let me take the decision tree works now let me take the decision tree works now let me take the same example and tell you the structure same example and tell you the structure same example and tell you the structure of a decision tree so first of all we of a decision tree so first of all we of a decision tree so first of all we have something known as the root node have something known as the root node have something known as the root node okay the root node is the starting point okay the root node is the starting point okay the root node is the starting point of a decision tree here you'll perform of a decision tree here you'll perform of a decision tree here you'll perform the first split and split into two other the first split and split into two other the first split and split into two other nodes or three other nodes depending on nodes or three other nodes depending on nodes or three other nodes depending on your problem statement right so the your problem statement right so the your problem statement right so the topmost node is known as your root node topmost node is known as your root node topmost node is known as your root node right now guys about the root node the right now guys about the root node the right now guys about the root node the root node is assigned to a variable that root node is assigned to a variable that root node is assigned to a variable that is very significant meaning that that is very significant meaning that that is very significant meaning that that variable is very important in predicting variable is very important in predicting variable is very important in predicting the output okay so you assign a variable the output okay so you assign a variable the output okay so you assign a variable that you think is the most significant that you think is the most significant that you think is the most significant at the root node after that we have at the root node after that we have at the root node after that we have something known as internal nodes so something known as internal nodes so something known as internal nodes so each internal node represents a decision each internal node represents a decision each internal node represents a decision point that eventually leads to the point that eventually leads to the point that eventually leads to the output right internal nodes will have output right internal nodes will have output right internal nodes will have other predictor variables right each of other predictor variables right each of other predictor variables right each of these are nothing but predictor these are nothing but predictor these are nothing but predictor variables I've just made it into a variables I've just made it into a variables I've just made it into a question otherwise these are just question otherwise these are just question otherwise these are just predictor variables right those are predictor variables right those are predictor variables right those are internal nodes terminal nodes also known internal nodes terminal nodes also known internal nodes terminal nodes also known as the leaf node represent the final as the leaf node represent the final as the leaf node represent the final class of the output variable okay so class of the output variable okay so class of the output variable okay so these are basically your outcomes nonv these are basically your outcomes nonv these are basically your outcomes nonv and vegetarian branches are nothing but and vegetarian branches are nothing but and vegetarian branches are nothing but connections between nodes okay these connections between nodes okay these connections between nodes okay these connections or links between each node connections or links between each node connections or links between each node is known as a branch and they are is known as a branch and they are is known as a branch and they are represented by arrows so each branch represented by arrows so each branch represented by arrows so each branch will have some response to it either yes will have some response to it either yes will have some response to it either yes or no true or false one or zero and so or no true or false one or zero and so or no true or false one or zero and so on okay so guys this is the structure of on okay so guys this is the structure of on okay so guys this is the structure of a decision Tre it's pretty a decision Tre it's pretty a decision Tre it's pretty understandable now let's move on and understandable now let's move on and understandable now let's move on and we'll understand how the decision Tre we'll understand how the decision Tre we'll understand how the decision Tre algorithm algorithm algorithm works now there are many ways to build a works now there are many ways to build a works now there are many ways to build a decision tree but uh I'll be focusing on decision tree but uh I'll be focusing on decision tree but uh I'll be focusing on something known as the ID3 algorithm something known as the ID3 algorithm something known as the ID3 algorithm okay there's something known as ID3 okay there's something known as ID3 okay there's something known as ID3 algorithm that is one of the ways in algorithm that is one of the ways in algorithm that is one of the ways in which you can build the decision tree which you can build the decision tree which you can build the decision tree ID3 stands for iterative dichotomize ID3 stands for iterative dichotomize ID3 stands for iterative dichotomize three algorithm which is one of the most three algorithm which is one of the most three algorithm which is one of the most effective algorithms used to build a effective algorithms used to build a effective algorithms used to build a decision tree all right it uses the decision tree all right it uses the decision tree all right it uses the concepts of entropy and Information Gain concepts of entropy and Information Gain concepts of entropy and Information Gain in order to build a decision tree now in order to build a decision tree now in order to build a decision tree now you don't have to know what exactly the you don't have to know what exactly the you don't have to know what exactly the ID3 algorithm is it's just a concept ID3 algorithm is it's just a concept ID3 algorithm is it's just a concept behind building a decision tree now the behind building a decision tree now the behind building a decision tree now the ID3 algorithm has around six defined ID3 algorithm has around six defined ID3 algorithm has around six defined steps in order to build a decision tree steps in order to build a decision tree steps in order to build a decision tree so the first step is you will select the so the first step is you will select the so the first step is you will select the best attribute now what do you mean by best attribute now what do you mean by best attribute now what do you mean by the best attribute so attribute is the best attribute so attribute is the best attribute so attribute is nothing but the predictor variable over nothing but the predictor variable over nothing but the predictor variable over here right so you'll select the best here right so you'll select the best here right so you'll select the best predictor variable let's call it a after predictor variable let's call it a after predictor variable let's call it a after that you'll assign this a as a decision that you'll assign this a as a decision that you'll assign this a as a decision variable for the root node basically variable for the root node basically variable for the root node basically you'll assign this predictor variable a you'll assign this predictor variable a you'll assign this predictor variable a at the root node next what you'll do is at the root node next what you'll do is at the root node next what you'll do is for each value of a you'll build a for each value of a you'll build a for each value of a you'll build a descendant of the node now these three descendant of the node now these three descendant of the node now these three steps let's look at it with the previous steps let's look at it with the previous steps let's look at it with the previous example now here the best attribute is example now here the best attribute is example now here the best attribute is eat chicken okay this is my best eat chicken okay this is my best eat chicken okay this is my best attribute variable over here so I attribute variable over here so I attribute variable over here so I selected that attribute and what was the selected that attribute and what was the selected that attribute and what was the next step step two is assign that as a next step step two is assign that as a next step step two is assign that as a decision variable so I assigned eat decision variable so I assigned eat decision variable so I assigned eat chicken as the decision variable at the chicken as the decision variable at the chicken as the decision variable at the root node now you might be wondering how root node now you might be wondering how root node now you might be wondering how do I know which is the best attribute do I know which is the best attribute do I know which is the best attribute right I'll explain all of that in a right I'll explain all of that in a right I'll explain all of that in a while so what we did is we assigned this while so what we did is we assigned this while so what we did is we assigned this at the root node after that step number at the root node after that step number at the root node after that step number three says for each value of a build a three says for each value of a build a three says for each value of a build a descendant of the node so for each value descendant of the node so for each value descendant of the node so for each value of this variable build a descendant node of this variable build a descendant node of this variable build a descendant node so this variable can take two values yes so this variable can take two values yes so this variable can take two values yes and no so for each of these values I and no so for each of these values I and no so for each of these values I build a descendant node right step build a descendant node right step build a descendant node right step number four assign classification labels number four assign classification labels number four assign classification labels to the leaf node to your Leaf node I to the leaf node to your Leaf node I to the leaf node to your Leaf node I have assigned classification one is non- have assigned classification one is non- have assigned classification one is non- wedge and the other is wedge that is wedge and the other is wedge that is wedge and the other is wedge that is Step number four step number five is if Step number four step number five is if Step number four step number five is if data is correctly classified then you data is correctly classified then you data is correctly classified then you stop at that however if it is not then stop at that however if it is not then stop at that however if it is not then you keep iterating over the tree and you you keep iterating over the tree and you you keep iterating over the tree and you keep changing the position of the uh keep changing the position of the uh keep changing the position of the uh predictor variables in the tree or you predictor variables in the tree or you predictor variables in the tree or you change the root node also in order to change the root node also in order to change the root node also in order to get the correct output so now let me get the correct output so now let me get the correct output so now let me answer this question what is the best answer this question what is the best answer this question what is the best attribute what do you mean by the best attribute what do you mean by the best attribute what do you mean by the best attribute or the best predictor variable attribute or the best predictor variable attribute or the best predictor variable now the best attribute is the one that now the best attribute is the one that now the best attribute is the one that separates the data into different separates the data into different separates the data into different classes most effectively or it is classes most effectively or it is classes most effectively or it is basically a feature that best splits the basically a feature that best splits the basically a feature that best splits the data set right now the next question in data set right now the next question in data set right now the next question in your head must be how do I decide which your head must be how do I decide which your head must be how do I decide which variable or which feature best splits variable or which feature best splits variable or which feature best splits the data to do this there are two the data to do this there are two the data to do this there are two important measures right there's important measures right there's important measures right there's something known as Information Gain and something known as Information Gain and something known as Information Gain and there's something known as entropy now there's something known as entropy now there's something known as entropy now guys in order to understand Information guys in order to understand Information guys in order to understand Information Gain and entropy we look at a simple Gain and entropy we look at a simple Gain and entropy we look at a simple problem statement this data set problem statement this data set problem statement this data set represents the speed of a car based on represents the speed of a car based on represents the speed of a car based on certain parameters so our problem certain parameters so our problem certain parameters so our problem statement here is to study the data set statement here is to study the data set statement here is to study the data set and create a decision tree that and create a decision tree that and create a decision tree that classifies the speed of a car as either classifies the speed of a car as either classifies the speed of a car as either slow or fast so a predictor variables slow or fast so a predictor variables slow or fast so a predictor variables here are Road type obstruction and speed here are Road type obstruction and speed here are Road type obstruction and speed limit and our response variable or our limit and our response variable or our limit and our response variable or our output variable is speed so we'll be output variable is speed so we'll be output variable is speed so we'll be building a decision tree using these building a decision tree using these building a decision tree using these variables in order to predict the speed variables in order to predict the speed variables in order to predict the speed of a car now like I mentioned earlier we of a car now like I mentioned earlier we of a car now like I mentioned earlier we must first begin by deciding a variable must first begin by deciding a variable must first begin by deciding a variable that best splits the data set and assign that best splits the data set and assign that best splits the data set and assign that particular variable to the root that particular variable to the root that particular variable to the root node and repeat the same thing for other node and repeat the same thing for other node and repeat the same thing for other nodes as well all right so step one like nodes as well all right so step one like nodes as well all right so step one like we discussed earlier is to select the we discussed earlier is to select the we discussed earlier is to select the best attribute a now how do you know best attribute a now how do you know best attribute a now how do you know which variable best separates the data which variable best separates the data which variable best separates the data the variable with the highest the variable with the highest the variable with the highest Information Gain best divides the data Information Gain best divides the data Information Gain best divides the data into the desired output classes first of into the desired output classes first of into the desired output classes first of all we'll calculate two measures we'll all we'll calculate two measures we'll all we'll calculate two measures we'll calculate the entropy and the calculate the entropy and the calculate the entropy and the information gain now this is where I information gain now this is where I information gain now this is where I tell you what exactly entropy is and tell you what exactly entropy is and tell you what exactly entropy is and what exactly Information Gain Is Now what exactly Information Gain Is Now what exactly Information Gain Is Now entropy is basically um used to measure entropy is basically um used to measure entropy is basically um used to measure the impurity or the uncertainty present the impurity or the uncertainty present the impurity or the uncertainty present in the data all right it is used to in the data all right it is used to in the data all right it is used to decide how a decision tree can split the decide how a decision tree can split the decide how a decision tree can split the data Information Gain on on the other data Information Gain on on the other data Information Gain on on the other hand is the most significant measure hand is the most significant measure hand is the most significant measure which is used to build a decision tree which is used to build a decision tree which is used to build a decision tree it indicates how much information a it indicates how much information a it indicates how much information a particular variable gives us about the particular variable gives us about the particular variable gives us about the final outcome so Information Gain is final outcome so Information Gain is final outcome so Information Gain is important because it is used to choose a important because it is used to choose a important because it is used to choose a variable that best splits the data at variable that best splits the data at variable that best splits the data at each node for a decision tree now the each node for a decision tree now the each node for a decision tree now the variable with the highest Information variable with the highest Information variable with the highest Information Gain will be used to split the data at Gain will be used to split the data at Gain will be used to split the data at the root node now in our data set there the root node now in our data set there the root node now in our data set there are four observations right so what are four observations right so what are four observations right so what we're going to do is we'll start by we're going to do is we'll start by we're going to do is we'll start by calculating the entropy and Information calculating the entropy and Information calculating the entropy and Information Gain for each of the predictor variable Gain for each of the predictor variable Gain for each of the predictor variable so we're going to start by calculating so we're going to start by calculating so we're going to start by calculating the information gain and entropy for the the information gain and entropy for the the information gain and entropy for the road type variable in our data set you road type variable in our data set you road type variable in our data set you can see that there are four observations can see that there are four observations can see that there are four observations right there are four observations in the right there are four observations in the right there are four observations in the road type column which correspond to the road type column which correspond to the road type column which correspond to the four labels in the speed column so we're four labels in the speed column so we're four labels in the speed column so we're going to begin by calculating the going to begin by calculating the going to begin by calculating the information gain of the parent node the information gain of the parent node the information gain of the parent node the parent node is nothing but the speed of parent node is nothing but the speed of parent node is nothing but the speed of the car node this is our output variable the car node this is our output variable the car node this is our output variable correct it'll be used used to show correct it'll be used used to show correct it'll be used used to show whether the uh speed of the car is low whether the uh speed of the car is low whether the uh speed of the car is low or fast so to find out the information or fast so to find out the information or fast so to find out the information gain of the uh speed of the car variable gain of the uh speed of the car variable gain of the uh speed of the car variable we'll go through a couple of steps now we'll go through a couple of steps now we'll go through a couple of steps now we know that there are four observations we know that there are four observations we know that there are four observations in this parent node right there is first in this parent node right there is first in this parent node right there is first we have slow then again we have slow we have slow then again we have slow we have slow then again we have slow fast and Fast now out of these four fast and Fast now out of these four fast and Fast now out of these four observations we have two classes right observations we have two classes right observations we have two classes right so two observations belong to the class so two observations belong to the class so two observations belong to the class low and two observations belong to the low and two observations belong to the low and two observations belong to the class fast class fast class fast so that's how you calculate P slow and P so that's how you calculate P slow and P so that's how you calculate P slow and P fast P slow is nothing but the fraction fast P slow is nothing but the fraction fast P slow is nothing but the fraction of slow outcomes in the parent node and of slow outcomes in the parent node and of slow outcomes in the parent node and P fast is a fraction of fast outcomes in P fast is a fraction of fast outcomes in P fast is a fraction of fast outcomes in the parent node and the formula to the parent node and the formula to the parent node and the formula to calculate P slow is the number of slow calculate P slow is the number of slow calculate P slow is the number of slow outcomes in the parent node divided by outcomes in the parent node divided by outcomes in the parent node divided by the total number of outcomes so the the total number of outcomes so the the total number of outcomes so the number of slow outcomes in the parent number of slow outcomes in the parent number of slow outcomes in the parent node is two and the total number of node is two and the total number of node is two and the total number of outcomes is four right we have four outcomes is four right we have four outcomes is four right we have four observations in total so that's how we observations in total so that's how we observations in total so that's how we get p of slow as get p of slow as get p of slow as 0.5 similarly for p of fast you'll 0.5 similarly for p of fast you'll 0.5 similarly for p of fast you'll calculate the number of fast outcomes calculate the number of fast outcomes calculate the number of fast outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes so again 2x 4 you'll get so again 2x 4 you'll get so again 2x 4 you'll get 0.5 the next thing you'll do is you'll 0.5 the next thing you'll do is you'll 0.5 the next thing you'll do is you'll calculate the entropy of this node so to calculate the entropy of this node so to calculate the entropy of this node so to calculate the entropy this is the calculate the entropy this is the calculate the entropy this is the formula all you have to do is you have formula all you have to do is you have formula all you have to do is you have to substitute the form you'll have to to substitute the form you'll have to to substitute the form you'll have to substitute the value in this formula substitute the value in this formula substitute the value in this formula right so P of slow we're substituting as right so P of slow we're substituting as right so P of slow we're substituting as 0.5 similarly P of fast as 0.5 now when 0.5 similarly P of fast as 0.5 now when 0.5 similarly P of fast as 0.5 now when you substitute the value you'll get a you substitute the value you'll get a you substitute the value you'll get a answer of one right so the entropy of answer of one right so the entropy of answer of one right so the entropy of your parent node is one so after your parent node is one so after your parent node is one so after calculating the entropy of the parent calculating the entropy of the parent calculating the entropy of the parent node we'll calculate the information node we'll calculate the information node we'll calculate the information gain of the child node now guys remember gain of the child node now guys remember gain of the child node now guys remember that if the information gain of the road that if the information gain of the road that if the information gain of the road type variable is greater than the type variable is greater than the type variable is greater than the information gain of all the other information gain of all the other information gain of all the other predictor variables only then the root predictor variables only then the root predictor variables only then the root node can be split by using the road type node can be split by using the road type node can be split by using the road type variable so to calculate the information variable so to calculate the information variable so to calculate the information gain of road type variable we first need gain of road type variable we first need gain of road type variable we first need to split the root node by using the road to split the root node by using the road to split the root node by using the road type variable right we is doing this in type variable right we is doing this in type variable right we is doing this in order to check if the road type variable order to check if the road type variable order to check if the road type variable is giving us maximum information about is giving us maximum information about is giving us maximum information about our data okay so if you notice that road our data okay so if you notice that road our data okay so if you notice that road type has two outcomes it has two values type has two outcomes it has two values type has two outcomes it has two values either steep or flat right now go back either steep or flat right now go back either steep or flat right now go back to our data set so here what you have to to our data set so here what you have to to our data set so here what you have to notice is whenever the row type is steep notice is whenever the row type is steep notice is whenever the row type is steep so first what we'll do is we'll check uh so first what we'll do is we'll check uh so first what we'll do is we'll check uh the value of speed that we get when the the value of speed that we get when the the value of speed that we get when the road type is steep so first observation road type is steep so first observation road type is steep so first observation you see that whenever the road type is you see that whenever the road type is you see that whenever the road type is steep you're getting a speed of slow steep you're getting a speed of slow steep you're getting a speed of slow similarly in the second observation when similarly in the second observation when similarly in the second observation when the row type is steep you'll get a value the row type is steep you'll get a value the row type is steep you'll get a value of slow again if the row type is flat of slow again if the row type is flat of slow again if the row type is flat you'll get an observation of fast and you'll get an observation of fast and you'll get an observation of fast and again if it is steep there is a value of again if it is steep there is a value of again if it is steep there is a value of fast right so for three steep values we fast right so for three steep values we fast right so for three steep values we have slow slow and fast and when the row have slow slow and fast and when the row have slow slow and fast and when the row type is flat we get an output of fast type is flat we get an output of fast type is flat we get an output of fast right that's exactly what I've done in right that's exactly what I've done in right that's exactly what I've done in this decision tree so whenever the road this decision tree so whenever the road this decision tree so whenever the road type is steep you'll get slow slow or type is steep you'll get slow slow or type is steep you'll get slow slow or fast and whenever the road type is flat fast and whenever the road type is flat fast and whenever the road type is flat you'll get fast right now the entropy of you'll get fast right now the entropy of you'll get fast right now the entropy of the right hand side is zero entropy is the right hand side is zero entropy is the right hand side is zero entropy is nothing but the uncertainty there's no nothing but the uncertainty there's no nothing but the uncertainty there's no uncertainty over here because as soon as uncertainty over here because as soon as uncertainty over here because as soon as you see that the road type is flat your you see that the road type is flat your you see that the road type is flat your output is fast right so there's no output is fast right so there's no output is fast right so there's no uncertainty but when the row type is uncertainty but when the row type is uncertainty but when the row type is steep you can have any one of the steep you can have any one of the steep you can have any one of the following outcomes either your speed following outcomes either your speed following outcomes either your speed will be slow or it can be fast right so will be slow or it can be fast right so will be slow or it can be fast right so you'll start by calculating the entropy you'll start by calculating the entropy you'll start by calculating the entropy of both rhs and LHS of the decision tree of both rhs and LHS of the decision tree of both rhs and LHS of the decision tree so the entropy for the right side child so the entropy for the right side child so the entropy for the right side child node will be zero right because there's node will be zero right because there's node will be zero right because there's no uncertainty here immediately if you no uncertainty here immediately if you no uncertainty here immediately if you see that the road type is flat your uh see that the road type is flat your uh see that the road type is flat your uh speed of the car will be fast okay so speed of the car will be fast okay so speed of the car will be fast okay so there's no uncertainty here and there's no uncertainty here and there's no uncertainty here and therefore your entropy becomes zero now therefore your entropy becomes zero now therefore your entropy becomes zero now entropy for the left hand side is you'll entropy for the left hand side is you'll entropy for the left hand side is you'll again have to calculate the fraction of again have to calculate the fraction of again have to calculate the fraction of P slow and the fraction of P fast so out P slow and the fraction of P fast so out P slow and the fraction of P fast so out of three observations in two of three observations in two of three observations in two observations we have slow that's why we observations we have slow that's why we observations we have slow that's why we have 2x3 over here similarly for p fast have 2x3 over here similarly for p fast have 2x3 over here similarly for p fast we have one p fast divided by the total we have one p fast divided by the total we have one p fast divided by the total number of observations which are three number of observations which are three number of observations which are three so out of these three we have two slows so out of these three we have two slows so out of these three we have two slows and one fast right when you calculate P and one fast right when you calculate P and one fast right when you calculate P slow and P fast you'll get these two slow and P fast you'll get these two slow and P fast you'll get these two values and then when you substitute the values and then when you substitute the values and then when you substitute the entropy in this formula you'll get the entropy in this formula you'll get the entropy in this formula you'll get the entropy as 0.9 for the road type entropy as 0.9 for the road type entropy as 0.9 for the road type variable right I hope you all are variable right I hope you all are variable right I hope you all are understanding this I'll go through this understanding this I'll go through this understanding this I'll go through this again so basically here we calculating again so basically here we calculating again so basically here we calculating the information gain and entropy for the information gain and entropy for the information gain and entropy for Road type variable right whenever you Road type variable right whenever you Road type variable right whenever you consider Road type variable there are consider Road type variable there are consider Road type variable there are two values Steep and flat and whenever two values Steep and flat and whenever two values Steep and flat and whenever the value for Road type is steep you'll the value for Road type is steep you'll the value for Road type is steep you'll get any one of these three outcomes get any one of these three outcomes get any one of these three outcomes either you'll get slow slow or fast and either you'll get slow slow or fast and either you'll get slow slow or fast and when the road type is flat your outcome when the road type is flat your outcome when the road type is flat your outcome will be fast now because there's no will be fast now because there's no will be fast now because there's no uncertainty whenever the road type is uncertainty whenever the road type is uncertainty whenever the road type is flat you'll always get an outcome of flat you'll always get an outcome of flat you'll always get an outcome of fast this means that the entropy here is fast this means that the entropy here is fast this means that the entropy here is zero or the uncertainty value here is zero or the uncertainty value here is zero or the uncertainty value here is zero but here there is a lot of zero but here there is a lot of zero but here there is a lot of uncertainty right so whenever your road uncertainty right so whenever your road uncertainty right so whenever your road type is steep your output can either be type is steep your output can either be type is steep your output can either be slow or it can be fast so finally you slow or it can be fast so finally you slow or it can be fast so finally you get the entropy as get the entropy as get the entropy as 0.9 so in order to calculate the 0.9 so in order to calculate the 0.9 so in order to calculate the information gain of the road type information gain of the road type information gain of the road type variable you need to calculate the variable you need to calculate the variable you need to calculate the weighted average right I'll tell you why weighted average right I'll tell you why weighted average right I'll tell you why in order to calculate the Information in order to calculate the Information in order to calculate the Information Gain you need to know the entropy of the Gain you need to know the entropy of the Gain you need to know the entropy of the parent which we calculated as one minus parent which we calculated as one minus parent which we calculated as one minus the weighted average into the entropy of the weighted average into the entropy of the weighted average into the entropy of the children okay so for this formula the children okay so for this formula the children okay so for this formula you need to calculate all of these you need to calculate all of these you need to calculate all of these values so first of all you need to values so first of all you need to values so first of all you need to calculate the entropy of the weighted calculate the entropy of the weighted calculate the entropy of the weighted average now the total number of outcomes average now the total number of outcomes average now the total number of outcomes in the parent node we saw were four the in the parent node we saw were four the in the parent node we saw were four the total number of outcomes in the left total number of outcomes in the left total number of outcomes in the left child node were three and the total child node were three and the total child node were three and the total number of outcomes in the right child number of outcomes in the right child number of outcomes in the right child node was one correct in order to verify node was one correct in order to verify node was one correct in order to verify this with you yeah the total number of this with you yeah the total number of this with you yeah the total number of outcomes in the parent node are four outcomes in the parent node are four outcomes in the parent node are four right 1 2 3 and four coming to the child right 1 2 3 and four coming to the child right 1 2 3 and four coming to the child node which is the road type the total node which is the road type the total node which is the road type the total number of outcomes on the right hand number of outcomes on the right hand number of outcomes on the right hand side of the child node is one and the side of the child node is one and the side of the child node is one and the total number of outcomes on the left total number of outcomes on the left total number of outcomes on the left hand side of the child node is three hand side of the child node is three hand side of the child node is three right that's exactly what I've written right that's exactly what I've written right that's exactly what I've written over here all right I hope you all over here all right I hope you all over here all right I hope you all understood these three values after that understood these three values after that understood these three values after that all you have to do is you have to all you have to do is you have to all you have to do is you have to substitute these values in this formula substitute these values in this formula substitute these values in this formula so when you do that you'll get the so when you do that you'll get the so when you do that you'll get the entropy of the children with weighted entropy of the children with weighted entropy of the children with weighted average will be around average will be around average will be around 0.675 all right now just substitute the 0.675 all right now just substitute the 0.675 all right now just substitute the value in this formula so if you value in this formula so if you value in this formula so if you calculate the information gain of the calculate the information gain of the calculate the information gain of the road type variable you'll get a value of road type variable you'll get a value of road type variable you'll get a value of 0.325 Now by using the same method 0.325 Now by using the same method 0.325 Now by using the same method you're going to calculate the you're going to calculate the you're going to calculate the information gain for each of the information gain for each of the information gain for each of the predictor variable for Road type for predictor variable for Road type for predictor variable for Road type for obstruction and for speed limit now when obstruction and for speed limit now when obstruction and for speed limit now when you follow the same method and you you follow the same method and you you follow the same method and you calculate the Information Gain you'll calculate the Information Gain you'll calculate the Information Gain you'll get these values now what does this get these values now what does this get these values now what does this information gain for Road type equal to information gain for Road type equal to information gain for Road type equal to 0.325 denote now the value 0.325 for 0.325 denote now the value 0.325 for 0.325 denote now the value 0.325 for Road type denotes that we getting very Road type denotes that we getting very Road type denotes that we getting very little Information Gain from this row little Information Gain from this row little Information Gain from this row type variable and for obstruction we type variable and for obstruction we type variable and for obstruction we literally have a Information Gain of literally have a Information Gain of literally have a Information Gain of zero similarly Information Gain for zero similarly Information Gain for zero similarly Information Gain for speed limit is one now this is the speed limit is one now this is the speed limit is one now this is the highest value we've got for Information highest value we've got for Information highest value we've got for Information Gain this means that we'll have to use Gain this means that we'll have to use Gain this means that we'll have to use the speed limit variable at our root the speed limit variable at our root the speed limit variable at our root node in order to split the data set node in order to split the data set node in order to split the data set right so guys don't get conf confuse right so guys don't get conf confuse right so guys don't get conf confuse whichever variable gives you the maximum whichever variable gives you the maximum whichever variable gives you the maximum Information Gain that variable has to be Information Gain that variable has to be Information Gain that variable has to be chosen at the root node so that's why we chosen at the root node so that's why we chosen at the root node so that's why we have the root node as speed limit so if have the root node as speed limit so if have the root node as speed limit so if you've maintained the speed limit then you've maintained the speed limit then you've maintained the speed limit then you're going to go slow but if you you're going to go slow but if you you're going to go slow but if you haven't maintained the speed limit then haven't maintained the speed limit then haven't maintained the speed limit then the speed of your car is going to be the speed of your car is going to be the speed of your car is going to be fast all right your entropy is literally fast all right your entropy is literally fast all right your entropy is literally zero and your Information Gain is one zero and your Information Gain is one zero and your Information Gain is one meaning that you can use this variable meaning that you can use this variable meaning that you can use this variable at your root node in order to split the at your root node in order to split the at your root node in order to split the data set because spe spe limit gives you data set because spe spe limit gives you data set because spe spe limit gives you the maximum Information Gain so guys I the maximum Information Gain so guys I the maximum Information Gain so guys I hope this use case is clear to all of hope this use case is clear to all of hope this use case is clear to all of you to sum everything up I'll just you to sum everything up I'll just you to sum everything up I'll just repeat the entire thing to you all once repeat the entire thing to you all once repeat the entire thing to you all once more so basically here you were given a more so basically here you were given a more so basically here you were given a problem statement in order to create a problem statement in order to create a problem statement in order to create a decision tree that classifies the speed decision tree that classifies the speed decision tree that classifies the speed of a car as either slow or fast right so of a car as either slow or fast right so of a car as either slow or fast right so you were given three predictor variables you were given three predictor variables you were given three predictor variables and this was your output variable and this was your output variable and this was your output variable Information Gain and entropy are Information Gain and entropy are Information Gain and entropy are basically two measures that are used to basically two measures that are used to basically two measures that are used to decide which variable will be assigned decide which variable will be assigned decide which variable will be assigned to the the root node of a decision tree to the the root node of a decision tree to the the root node of a decision tree okay so guys as soon as you look at the okay so guys as soon as you look at the okay so guys as soon as you look at the data set if you compare these two data set if you compare these two data set if you compare these two columns that is speed limit and speed columns that is speed limit and speed columns that is speed limit and speed you'll get an output easily meaning that you'll get an output easily meaning that you'll get an output easily meaning that if you're maintaining speed limit you're if you're maintaining speed limit you're if you're maintaining speed limit you're going to go slow but if you aren't going to go slow but if you aren't going to go slow but if you aren't maintaining speed limit you're going to maintaining speed limit you're going to maintaining speed limit you're going to go fast right so here itself you can go fast right so here itself you can go fast right so here itself you can understand that speed limit has no understand that speed limit has no understand that speed limit has no uncertainty so every time you've uncertainty so every time you've uncertainty so every time you've maintained your speed limit you will be maintained your speed limit you will be maintained your speed limit you will be going slow and every time you're outside going slow and every time you're outside going slow and every time you're outside your speed limit you will be going fast your speed limit you will be going fast your speed limit you will be going fast all right it's as simple as that so how all right it's as simple as that so how all right it's as simple as that so how did you did you did you start so you started by calculating the start so you started by calculating the start so you started by calculating the entropy of the parent node okay you entropy of the parent node okay you entropy of the parent node okay you calculated the entropy of the parent calculated the entropy of the parent calculated the entropy of the parent node which came down to one okay after node which came down to one okay after node which came down to one okay after that you calculated the information gain that you calculated the information gain that you calculated the information gain of each of the child nodes in order to of each of the child nodes in order to of each of the child nodes in order to calculate the information gain of the calculate the information gain of the calculate the information gain of the child node you start by calculating the child node you start by calculating the child node you start by calculating the entropy of the right hand side and the entropy of the right hand side and the entropy of the right hand side and the left hand side of the decision tree okay left hand side of the decision tree okay left hand side of the decision tree okay then you calculate the entropy along then you calculate the entropy along then you calculate the entropy along with the weighted average you substitute with the weighted average you substitute with the weighted average you substitute these values in the Information Gain these values in the Information Gain these values in the Information Gain formula and you get the information gain formula and you get the information gain formula and you get the information gain for each of the predictor variables so for each of the predictor variables so for each of the predictor variables so after you get the information gain of after you get the information gain of after you get the information gain of each of the predictor variables you each of the predictor variables you each of the predictor variables you check which variable gives you the check which variable gives you the check which variable gives you the maximum Information Gain and you assign maximum Information Gain and you assign maximum Information Gain and you assign that variable to your root node it's as that variable to your root node it's as that variable to your root node it's as simple as that so guys that was all simple as that so guys that was all simple as that so guys that was all about decision trees now let's look at about decision trees now let's look at about decision trees now let's look at our next classification algorithm which our next classification algorithm which our next classification algorithm which is random Forest now first of all what is random Forest now first of all what is random Forest now first of all what is a random Forest random Forest is a random Forest random Forest is a random Forest random Forest basically builds multiple decision trees basically builds multiple decision trees basically builds multiple decision trees and glues them together to get a more and glues them together to get a more and glues them together to get a more accurate and stable prediction now if we accurate and stable prediction now if we accurate and stable prediction now if we already have decision trees and random already have decision trees and random already have decision trees and random Forest is nothing but a collection of Forest is nothing but a collection of Forest is nothing but a collection of decision trees why do we have to use decision trees why do we have to use decision trees why do we have to use random Forest when we already have random Forest when we already have random Forest when we already have decision trees the three main reasons decision trees the three main reasons decision trees the three main reasons why random Forest is used now even why random Forest is used now even why random Forest is used now even though decision trees are convenient and though decision trees are convenient and though decision trees are convenient and easily implemented they are not as easily implemented they are not as easily implemented they are not as accurate as random Forest okay decision accurate as random Forest okay decision accurate as random Forest okay decision trees work very effectively with the trees work very effectively with the trees work very effectively with the training data but they're not flexible training data but they're not flexible training data but they're not flexible when it comes to classifying a new when it comes to classifying a new when it comes to classifying a new sample right now this happens because of sample right now this happens because of sample right now this happens because of something known as overfitting now something known as overfitting now something known as overfitting now overfitting is a problem that is seen overfitting is a problem that is seen overfitting is a problem that is seen with decision trees okay it's something with decision trees okay it's something with decision trees okay it's something that commonly occurs when you use that commonly occurs when you use that commonly occurs when you use decision trees now overfitting occurs decision trees now overfitting occurs decision trees now overfitting occurs when a model studies the training data when a model studies the training data when a model studies the training data to such an extent that it negatively to such an extent that it negatively to such an extent that it negatively influences the performance of the model influences the performance of the model influences the performance of the model on the new data on the new data on the new data all right now this means that the all right now this means that the all right now this means that the disturbance in the training data is disturbance in the training data is disturbance in the training data is recorded and it is learned as concepts recorded and it is learned as concepts recorded and it is learned as concepts by the model if there's any disturbance by the model if there's any disturbance by the model if there's any disturbance or any sort of noise in the training or any sort of noise in the training or any sort of noise in the training data or any error in the training data data or any error in the training data data or any error in the training data that is also studied by the model the that is also studied by the model the that is also studied by the model the problem here is that these Concepts do problem here is that these Concepts do problem here is that these Concepts do not apply to the testing data and it not apply to the testing data and it not apply to the testing data and it negatively impacts the model's ability negatively impacts the model's ability negatively impacts the model's ability to classify new data so to Summit up to classify new data so to Summit up to classify new data so to Summit up overfitting occurs whenever your your overfitting occurs whenever your your overfitting occurs whenever your your model learns the training data along model learns the training data along model learns the training data along with all the disturbance in the training with all the disturbance in the training with all the disturbance in the training data so it's basically memorized the data so it's basically memorized the data so it's basically memorized the training data and whenever a new data training data and whenever a new data training data and whenever a new data will be given to your model it will not will be given to your model it will not will be given to your model it will not predict the outcome very accurately now predict the outcome very accurately now predict the outcome very accurately now this is a problem seen in decision trees this is a problem seen in decision trees this is a problem seen in decision trees okay but in random Forest there's okay but in random Forest there's okay but in random Forest there's something known as bagging now the basic something known as bagging now the basic something known as bagging now the basic idea behind bagging is to reduce the idea behind bagging is to reduce the idea behind bagging is to reduce the variations in the predictions by variations in the predictions by variations in the predictions by combining the result of multiple combining the result of multiple combining the result of multiple decision trees on different samples of decision trees on different samples of decision trees on different samples of the data set set so your data set will the data set set so your data set will the data set set so your data set will be divided into different samples and be divided into different samples and be divided into different samples and you'll be building a decision Tree on you'll be building a decision Tree on you'll be building a decision Tree on each of these samples this way each each of these samples this way each each of these samples this way each decision tree will be studying one decision tree will be studying one decision tree will be studying one subset of your data so this way subset of your data so this way subset of your data so this way overfitting will get reduced because one overfitting will get reduced because one overfitting will get reduced because one decision tree is not studying the entire decision tree is not studying the entire decision tree is not studying the entire data set right now let's focus on random data set right now let's focus on random data set right now let's focus on random Forest now in order to understand random Forest now in order to understand random Forest now in order to understand random Forest we look at a small example okay Forest we look at a small example okay Forest we look at a small example okay consider this data set in this data we consider this data set in this data we consider this data set in this data we have four predictor variables we have have four predictor variables we have have four predictor variables we have blood flow blocked arteries chest pain blood flow blocked arteries chest pain blood flow blocked arteries chest pain and weight now these variables are used and weight now these variables are used and weight now these variables are used to predict whether or not a person has a to predict whether or not a person has a to predict whether or not a person has a heart disease so we're going to use this heart disease so we're going to use this heart disease so we're going to use this data set to create a random Forest that data set to create a random Forest that data set to create a random Forest that predicts if a person has a heart disease predicts if a person has a heart disease predicts if a person has a heart disease or not now the first step in creating a or not now the first step in creating a or not now the first step in creating a random Forest is that you create a random Forest is that you create a random Forest is that you create a bootstrapped data set now in bootstrapped data set now in bootstrapped data set now in bootstrapping all you have to do is you bootstrapping all you have to do is you bootstrapping all you have to do is you have to randomly select samples from have to randomly select samples from have to randomly select samples from your original data set okay and a point your original data set okay and a point your original data set okay and a point to note is that you can select select to note is that you can select select to note is that you can select select the same sample more than once all right the same sample more than once all right the same sample more than once all right so if you look at the original data set so if you look at the original data set so if you look at the original data set we have abnormal normal Normal and we have abnormal normal Normal and we have abnormal normal Normal and abnormal right look at the blood flow abnormal right look at the blood flow abnormal right look at the blood flow section now here I've randomly selected section now here I've randomly selected section now here I've randomly selected samples normal abnormal and I've samples normal abnormal and I've samples normal abnormal and I've selected one sample twice all right you selected one sample twice all right you selected one sample twice all right you can do this in a bootstrap data set now can do this in a bootstrap data set now can do this in a bootstrap data set now all I did here is I created a bootstrap all I did here is I created a bootstrap all I did here is I created a bootstrap data set bootstrapping is nothing but an data set bootstrapping is nothing but an data set bootstrapping is nothing but an estimation method used to make estimation method used to make estimation method used to make predictions on a data by resampling the predictions on a data by resampling the predictions on a data by resampling the data right this is a bootstrap data set data right this is a bootstrap data set data right this is a bootstrap data set now even though this seems very simple now even though this seems very simple now even though this seems very simple in real world problems you'll never get in real world problems you'll never get in real world problems you'll never get such a small data set okay so such a small data set okay so such a small data set okay so bootstrapping is actually a little more bootstrapping is actually a little more bootstrapping is actually a little more complex than this usually in real world complex than this usually in real world complex than this usually in real world problems you have a huge data set and problems you have a huge data set and problems you have a huge data set and bootstrapping that data set is actually bootstrapping that data set is actually bootstrapping that data set is actually a pretty complex problem now here a pretty complex problem now here a pretty complex problem now here because I'm making you understand how because I'm making you understand how because I'm making you understand how random Forest works so that's why I've random Forest works so that's why I've random Forest works so that's why I've considered a small data set now you're considered a small data set now you're considered a small data set now you're going to use the bootstrap data set that going to use the bootstrap data set that going to use the bootstrap data set that you created and you're going to build you created and you're going to build you created and you're going to build dis trees from it now one more thing to dis trees from it now one more thing to dis trees from it now one more thing to note in random Forest is you will not be note in random Forest is you will not be note in random Forest is you will not be using your entire data set okay so using your entire data set okay so using your entire data set okay so you'll only be using few of the you'll only be using few of the you'll only be using few of the variables at each node so for example uh variables at each node so for example uh variables at each node so for example uh we'll only consider two variables at we'll only consider two variables at we'll only consider two variables at each step so if we begin at the root each step so if we begin at the root each step so if we begin at the root node here we will randomly select two node here we will randomly select two node here we will randomly select two variables as candidates for the root variables as candidates for the root variables as candidates for the root node okay let's say that we selected node okay let's say that we selected node okay let's say that we selected blood flow and blocked arteries right blood flow and blocked arteries right blood flow and blocked arteries right out of these two variables we have to out of these two variables we have to out of these two variables we have to select the variable that best separates select the variable that best separates select the variable that best separates the sample the sample the sample okay so for the sake of this example okay so for the sake of this example okay so for the sake of this example let's say that blocked arteries is a let's say that blocked arteries is a let's say that blocked arteries is a most significant predictor and that's most significant predictor and that's most significant predictor and that's why we'll assign it to the root node now why we'll assign it to the root node now why we'll assign it to the root node now our next step is to repeat the same our next step is to repeat the same our next step is to repeat the same process for each of these upcoming process for each of these upcoming process for each of these upcoming Branch nodes here we'll again select two Branch nodes here we'll again select two Branch nodes here we'll again select two variables at random as candidates for variables at random as candidates for variables at random as candidates for each of these Branch nodes and then each of these Branch nodes and then each of these Branch nodes and then choose a variable that best separates choose a variable that best separates choose a variable that best separates the samples right so let me just repeat the samples right so let me just repeat the samples right so let me just repeat this entire process so you know that you this entire process so you know that you this entire process so you know that you start creating a decision Tree by start creating a decision Tree by start creating a decision Tree by selecting the root node in random Forest selecting the root node in random Forest selecting the root node in random Forest you'll randomly select a couple of you'll randomly select a couple of you'll randomly select a couple of variables for each node and then you'll variables for each node and then you'll variables for each node and then you'll calculate which variable best splits the calculate which variable best splits the calculate which variable best splits the data at that node so for each node we'll data at that node so for each node we'll data at that node so for each node we'll randomly select two or three variables randomly select two or three variables randomly select two or three variables and out of those two three variables and out of those two three variables and out of those two three variables we'll see which variable best separates we'll see which variable best separates we'll see which variable best separates the data okay so at each node we'll be the data okay so at each node we'll be the data okay so at each node we'll be calculating Information Gain and entropy calculating Information Gain and entropy calculating Information Gain and entropy basically that's what I mean at every basically that's what I mean at every basically that's what I mean at every node you'll calculate Information Gain node you'll calculate Information Gain node you'll calculate Information Gain and entropy of two or three variables and entropy of two or three variables and entropy of two or three variables and you'll see which variable has has and you'll see which variable has has and you'll see which variable has has the highest Information Gain and you'll the highest Information Gain and you'll the highest Information Gain and you'll keep descending downwards that's how you keep descending downwards that's how you keep descending downwards that's how you create a decision dream so we just create a decision dream so we just create a decision dream so we just created our first decision tree now what created our first decision tree now what created our first decision tree now what you do is you'll go back to step one and you do is you'll go back to step one and you do is you'll go back to step one and you'll repeat the entire process so each you'll repeat the entire process so each you'll repeat the entire process so each decision tree will predict the output decision tree will predict the output decision tree will predict the output class based on the predictor variables class based on the predictor variables class based on the predictor variables that you have assigned to each decision that you have assigned to each decision that you have assigned to each decision tree now let's say for this decision tree now let's say for this decision tree now let's say for this decision tree you have assigned blood flow here tree you have assigned blood flow here tree you have assigned blood flow here we have blocked arteries at the root we have blocked arteries at the root we have blocked arteries at the root node here we might have blood flow at node here we might have blood flow at node here we might have blood flow at the root node and so on so your output the root node and so on so your output the root node and so on so your output will depend on which predictor variable will depend on which predictor variable will depend on which predictor variable is at the root node right so each is at the root node right so each is at the root node right so each decision tree will predict the output decision tree will predict the output decision tree will predict the output class based on the predictive variable class based on the predictive variable class based on the predictive variable that you assigned in that tree all right that you assigned in that tree all right that you assigned in that tree all right now what you do is you'll go back to now what you do is you'll go back to now what you do is you'll go back to step one you'll create a new bootstrap step one you'll create a new bootstrap step one you'll create a new bootstrap data set and then again you'll build a data set and then again you'll build a data set and then again you'll build a new decision tree and for that decision new decision tree and for that decision new decision tree and for that decision tree you'll consider only a subset of tree you'll consider only a subset of tree you'll consider only a subset of variables and you'll choose the best variables and you'll choose the best variables and you'll choose the best predictor variable by calculating the predictor variable by calculating the predictor variable by calculating the information gain right so you'll keep information gain right so you'll keep information gain right so you'll keep repeating this process so you just keep repeating this process so you just keep repeating this process so you just keep repeating step two and step one okay and repeating step two and step one okay and repeating step two and step one okay and you'll keep creating multiple decision you'll keep creating multiple decision you'll keep creating multiple decision trees okay so having a variety of trees okay so having a variety of trees okay so having a variety of decision trees in a random Forest is decision trees in a random Forest is decision trees in a random Forest is what makes it more effective than an what makes it more effective than an what makes it more effective than an individual decision tree right so individual decision tree right so individual decision tree right so instead of having a individual decision instead of having a individual decision instead of having a individual decision tree which is created using all the tree which is created using all the tree which is created using all the features you can build a random Forest features you can build a random Forest features you can build a random Forest that uses multiple decision trees where that uses multiple decision trees where that uses multiple decision trees where in each decision tree has a random set in each decision tree has a random set in each decision tree has a random set of predictor variables now step number of predictor variables now step number of predictor variables now step number four is predicting the outcome of a new four is predicting the outcome of a new four is predicting the outcome of a new data point so now that you've created a data point so now that you've created a data point so now that you've created a random Forest let's see how it can be random Forest let's see how it can be random Forest let's see how it can be used to predict whether a new patient used to predict whether a new patient used to predict whether a new patient has a heart disease or not okay now this has a heart disease or not okay now this has a heart disease or not okay now this diagram basically has the data about the diagram basically has the data about the diagram basically has the data about the new patient okay this is the data about new patient okay this is the data about new patient okay this is the data about the new patient he doesn't have blocked the new patient he doesn't have blocked the new patient he doesn't have blocked arteries he has chest pain and his arteries he has chest pain and his arteries he has chest pain and his weight is around 185 kgs now all you weight is around 185 kgs now all you weight is around 185 kgs now all you have to do is you have to run this data have to do is you have to run this data have to do is you have to run this data down each of the decision trees that you down each of the decision trees that you down each of the decision trees that you have made so the first decision tree have made so the first decision tree have made so the first decision tree shows that yes this person has heart shows that yes this person has heart shows that yes this person has heart disease similarly you'll run the disease similarly you'll run the disease similarly you'll run the information of this new patient through information of this new patient through information of this new patient through every decision tree that you created every decision tree that you created every decision tree that you created then depending on how many votes you get then depending on how many votes you get then depending on how many votes you get for yes and no you will classify that for yes and no you will classify that for yes and no you will classify that patient as either having heart disease patient as either having heart disease patient as either having heart disease or not all you have to do is you have to or not all you have to do is you have to or not all you have to do is you have to run the information of the new patient run the information of the new patient run the information of the new patient through all the decision trees that you through all the decision trees that you through all the decision trees that you created in the previous step and the created in the previous step and the created in the previous step and the final output is based on the number of V final output is based on the number of V final output is based on the number of V what's each of the classes getting okay what's each of the classes getting okay what's each of the classes getting okay let's say that three decision trees said let's say that three decision trees said let's say that three decision trees said that yes the patient has heart disease that yes the patient has heart disease that yes the patient has heart disease and one decision tree said that no it and one decision tree said that no it and one decision tree said that no it doesn't have so this means you will doesn't have so this means you will doesn't have so this means you will obviously classify the patient as having obviously classify the patient as having obviously classify the patient as having a heart disease because three of them a heart disease because three of them a heart disease because three of them voted for yes right it's based on voted for yes right it's based on voted for yes right it's based on majority all right so guys I hope the majority all right so guys I hope the majority all right so guys I hope the concept behind random Forest is concept behind random Forest is concept behind random Forest is understandable now the next step is you understandable now the next step is you understandable now the next step is you will evaluate the efficiency of the will evaluate the efficiency of the will evaluate the efficiency of the model now earlier when we created uh the model now earlier when we created uh the model now earlier when we created uh the bootstrap data set we left out one entry bootstrap data set we left out one entry bootstrap data set we left out one entry sample right this is the entry sample we sample right this is the entry sample we sample right this is the entry sample we left out because we repeated one sample left out because we repeated one sample left out because we repeated one sample twice if you all remember in the twice if you all remember in the twice if you all remember in the bootstrap data set here we repeated an bootstrap data set here we repeated an bootstrap data set here we repeated an entry twice and we missed out on one of entry twice and we missed out on one of entry twice and we missed out on one of the entries right we missed out on one the entries right we missed out on one the entries right we missed out on one of the entries so what we're going to do of the entries so what we're going to do of the entries so what we're going to do is so for evaluating the model we'll be is so for evaluating the model we'll be is so for evaluating the model we'll be using the data entry that we missed out using the data entry that we missed out using the data entry that we missed out on okay now in a real world problem on okay now in a real world problem on okay now in a real world problem about 1/3 of the original data set is is about 1/3 of the original data set is is about 1/3 of the original data set is is not included in the bootstrap data set not included in the bootstrap data set not included in the bootstrap data set right because there's a huge amount of right because there's a huge amount of right because there's a huge amount of data in a real world problem so 1/3 of data in a real world problem so 1/3 of data in a real world problem so 1/3 of the original data set is not included in the original data set is not included in the original data set is not included in the bootstrap data set so guys the the bootstrap data set so guys the the bootstrap data set so guys the sample data set which is not there in sample data set which is not there in sample data set which is not there in your bootstrap data set is known as out your bootstrap data set is known as out your bootstrap data set is known as out of bag data set okay so basically this of bag data set okay so basically this of bag data set okay so basically this is our out of bag data set now the out is our out of bag data set now the out is our out of bag data set now the out of bag data set is used to check the of bag data set is used to check the of bag data set is used to check the accuracy of the model now because the accuracy of the model now because the accuracy of the model now because the model was not created by using the out model was not created by using the out model was not created by using the out ofb data set it will give us a good ofb data set it will give us a good ofb data set it will give us a good understanding of whether the model is understanding of whether the model is understanding of whether the model is effective or not now the out ofb data effective or not now the out ofb data effective or not now the out ofb data set is nothing but your testing data set set is nothing but your testing data set set is nothing but your testing data set right remember in machine learning right remember in machine learning right remember in machine learning there's training and testing data set so there's training and testing data set so there's training and testing data set so your OU ofb data set is nothing but your your OU ofb data set is nothing but your your OU ofb data set is nothing but your testing data set this is used to testing data set this is used to testing data set this is used to evaluate the efficiency of your model So evaluate the efficiency of your model So evaluate the efficiency of your model So eventually you can measure the accuracy eventually you can measure the accuracy eventually you can measure the accuracy of a random Forest by the proportion of of a random Forest by the proportion of of a random Forest by the proportion of out of bag samples that are correctly out of bag samples that are correctly out of bag samples that are correctly classified right because the outou of classified right because the outou of classified right because the outou of bag data set is used to evaluate the bag data set is used to evaluate the bag data set is used to evaluate the efficiency of your model so you can efficiency of your model so you can efficiency of your model so you can calculate the accuracy by understanding calculate the accuracy by understanding calculate the accuracy by understanding how many samples was this out ofb data how many samples was this out ofb data how many samples was this out ofb data set correctly able to set correctly able to set correctly able to classify so guys that was an explanation classify so guys that was an explanation classify so guys that was an explanation about how random Forest Works to give about how random Forest Works to give about how random Forest Works to give you an overview let me just run you you an overview let me just run you you an overview let me just run you through all the steps that we took so through all the steps that we took so through all the steps that we took so basically this was our data set and all basically this was our data set and all basically this was our data set and all we have to do is we have to predict we have to do is we have to predict we have to do is we have to predict whether a patient has heart disease or whether a patient has heart disease or whether a patient has heart disease or not so our first step was to create a not so our first step was to create a not so our first step was to create a boot strap data set a bootstrap data set boot strap data set a bootstrap data set boot strap data set a bootstrap data set is nothing but randomly selected is nothing but randomly selected is nothing but randomly selected observations from your original data set observations from your original data set observations from your original data set and you can also have duplicate values and you can also have duplicate values and you can also have duplicate values in your bootstop data set okay the next in your bootstop data set okay the next in your bootstop data set okay the next step is you're going to create a step is you're going to create a step is you're going to create a decision Tree by considering a random decision Tree by considering a random decision Tree by considering a random set of predictor variables for each set of predictor variables for each set of predictor variables for each decision tree okay so the third step is decision tree okay so the third step is decision tree okay so the third step is you'll go back to Step One create a you'll go back to Step One create a you'll go back to Step One create a bootstrap data set again create a bootstrap data set again create a bootstrap data set again create a decision tree so this iteration is decision tree so this iteration is decision tree so this iteration is performed hundreds of times until you performed hundreds of times until you performed hundreds of times until you have multiple decision trees right now have multiple decision trees right now have multiple decision trees right now that you've created a random Forest that you've created a random Forest that you've created a random Forest you'll use this random Forest to predict you'll use this random Forest to predict you'll use this random Forest to predict the outcome so if you're given a new the outcome so if you're given a new the outcome so if you're given a new data point and you have to classify it data point and you have to classify it data point and you have to classify it into one of the two classes you'll just into one of the two classes you'll just into one of the two classes you'll just run this new information through all the run this new information through all the run this new information through all the decision treats and you'll just take the decision treats and you'll just take the decision treats and you'll just take the majority of the output that you're majority of the output that you're majority of the output that you're getting from the decision trees as your getting from the decision trees as your getting from the decision trees as your outcome now in order to evaluate the outcome now in order to evaluate the outcome now in order to evaluate the efficiency of the model you'll use the efficiency of the model you'll use the efficiency of the model you'll use the out of the bag sample data set right now out of the bag sample data set right now out of the bag sample data set right now the out of bag sample is basically the the out of bag sample is basically the the out of bag sample is basically the sample that was not included in your sample that was not included in your sample that was not included in your bootstrap data set but this sample is bootstrap data set but this sample is bootstrap data set but this sample is coming from your original data set guys coming from your original data set guys coming from your original data set guys this is not something that you randomly this is not something that you randomly this is not something that you randomly create all right this data set was there create all right this data set was there create all right this data set was there in your original data set but it was in your original data set but it was in your original data set but it was just not mentioned in your bootstrap just not mentioned in your bootstrap just not mentioned in your bootstrap data set right so you'll use your out of data set right so you'll use your out of data set right so you'll use your out of bag sample in order to calculate the bag sample in order to calculate the bag sample in order to calculate the accuracy of your random Forest right so accuracy of your random Forest right so accuracy of your random Forest right so the proportion of out of bag samples the proportion of out of bag samples the proportion of out of bag samples that are correctly classified will give that are correctly classified will give that are correctly classified will give you the accuracy of your model so that you the accuracy of your model so that you the accuracy of your model so that is all for random for Forest so guys is all for random for Forest so guys is all for random for Forest so guys I'll discuss other classification I'll discuss other classification I'll discuss other classification algorithms with you and only then I'll algorithms with you and only then I'll algorithms with you and only then I'll show you a demo on the classification show you a demo on the classification show you a demo on the classification algorithms right now our next algorithm algorithms right now our next algorithm algorithms right now our next algorithm is something known as KN bias right KN is something known as KN bias right KN is something known as KN bias right KN bias is again a supervised uh bias is again a supervised uh bias is again a supervised uh classification algorithm which is based classification algorithm which is based classification algorithm which is based on the base theorem now the base theorem on the base theorem now the base theorem on the base theorem now the base theorem basically follows a probabilistic basically follows a probabilistic basically follows a probabilistic approach the main idea behind knif bias approach the main idea behind knif bias approach the main idea behind knif bias is that the predictor variables in a is that the predictor variables in a is that the predictor variables in a machine Lear learning model are machine Lear learning model are machine Lear learning model are independent of each other meaning that independent of each other meaning that independent of each other meaning that the outcome of a model depends on a set the outcome of a model depends on a set the outcome of a model depends on a set of independent variables that have of independent variables that have of independent variables that have nothing to do with each other right now nothing to do with each other right now nothing to do with each other right now a lot of you might ask why is naive bias a lot of you might ask why is naive bias a lot of you might ask why is naive bias called naive now usually when I tell called naive now usually when I tell called naive now usually when I tell anybody about naive bias they keep anybody about naive bias they keep anybody about naive bias they keep asking me why is naive bias called naive asking me why is naive bias called naive asking me why is naive bias called naive so in real world problems predictor so in real world problems predictor so in real world problems predictor variables aren't always independent of variables aren't always independent of variables aren't always independent of each other there is always some each other there is always some each other there is always some correlation between the independent correlation between the independent correlation between the independent variables now because naive bias variables now because naive bias variables now because naive bias considers each predictor variable to be considers each predictor variable to be considers each predictor variable to be independent of any other variable in the independent of any other variable in the independent of any other variable in the model it is called naive right this is model it is called naive right this is model it is called naive right this is an assumption that naive bias takes now an assumption that naive bias takes now an assumption that naive bias takes now let's understand the math behind the let's understand the math behind the let's understand the math behind the naive bias algorithm so like I mentioned naive bias algorithm so like I mentioned naive bias algorithm so like I mentioned the principle behind naive bias is the the principle behind naive bias is the the principle behind naive bias is the bias theorem which is also known as a bias theorem which is also known as a bias theorem which is also known as a bias rule okay the bias theorem is used bias rule okay the bias theorem is used bias rule okay the bias theorem is used to calculate the conditional probability to calculate the conditional probability to calculate the conditional probability which is nothing but the probability of which is nothing but the probability of which is nothing but the probability of a an event occurring based on a an event occurring based on a an event occurring based on information about the events in the past information about the events in the past information about the events in the past right this is the mathematical equation right this is the mathematical equation right this is the mathematical equation uh for the bias theorem now in this uh for the bias theorem now in this uh for the bias theorem now in this equation the LHS is nothing but the equation the LHS is nothing but the equation the LHS is nothing but the conditional probability of event a conditional probability of event a conditional probability of event a occurring given the event B P of a is occurring given the event B P of a is occurring given the event B P of a is nothing but probability of event a nothing but probability of event a nothing but probability of event a occurring P of B is probability of event occurring P of B is probability of event occurring P of B is probability of event B and PB of a is nothing but the B and PB of a is nothing but the B and PB of a is nothing but the conditional probability of event B conditional probability of event B conditional probability of event B occurring given the event a occurring given the event a occurring given the event a now let's try to understand how naive now let's try to understand how naive now let's try to understand how naive bias works now consider this data set of bias works now consider this data set of bias works now consider this data set of around 1,500 observations okay here we around 1,500 observations okay here we around 1,500 observations okay here we have the following output classes we have the following output classes we have the following output classes we have either cat parrot or Turtle okay have either cat parrot or Turtle okay have either cat parrot or Turtle okay these are our output classes and the these are our output classes and the these are our output classes and the predictive variables are uh swim Wings predictive variables are uh swim Wings predictive variables are uh swim Wings green color and sharp teeth okay so green color and sharp teeth okay so green color and sharp teeth okay so basically your type is your output basically your type is your output basically your type is your output variable and swim Wings Green and sharp variable and swim Wings Green and sharp variable and swim Wings Green and sharp teeth are your predictor variables your teeth are your predictor variables your teeth are your predictor variables your output variable has three classes cat output variable has three classes cat output variable has three classes cat parrot and turtle okay now I've parrot and turtle okay now I've parrot and turtle okay now I've summarized this table as shown on the summarized this table as shown on the summarized this table as shown on the screen all right the first thing you can screen all right the first thing you can screen all right the first thing you can see is the class of type cats shows that see is the class of type cats shows that see is the class of type cats shows that out of 500 cats 450 can swim right out of 500 cats 450 can swim right out of 500 cats 450 can swim right meaning that 90% of them can and zero meaning that 90% of them can and zero meaning that 90% of them can and zero number of cats have wings and zero number of cats have wings and zero number of cats have wings and zero number of cats are green in color and number of cats are green in color and number of cats are green in color and 500 out of 500 cats have sharp te teeth 500 out of 500 cats have sharp te teeth 500 out of 500 cats have sharp te teeth okay now coming to parrots it says 50 okay now coming to parrots it says 50 okay now coming to parrots it says 50 out of 500 parrots have true value for out of 500 parrots have true value for out of 500 parrots have true value for swim now guys obviously this does not swim now guys obviously this does not swim now guys obviously this does not hold true in real world right I don't hold true in real world right I don't hold true in real world right I don't think there are any parrots who can swim think there are any parrots who can swim think there are any parrots who can swim but I've just created this data set so but I've just created this data set so but I've just created this data set so that you can understand naive bias right that you can understand naive bias right that you can understand naive bias right so meaning that 10% of parrots have true so meaning that 10% of parrots have true so meaning that 10% of parrots have true value for swim now all 500 parrots have value for swim now all 500 parrots have value for swim now all 500 parrots have wings and 400 out of 500 parrots are wings and 400 out of 500 parrots are wings and 400 out of 500 parrots are green in color and zero parrots have green in color and zero parrots have green in color and zero parrots have sharp teeth right coming to the turtle sharp teeth right coming to the turtle sharp teeth right coming to the turtle class all 500 Turtles can swim zero class all 500 Turtles can swim zero class all 500 Turtles can swim zero number of turtles have wings and out of number of turtles have wings and out of number of turtles have wings and out of 500 100 Turtles are green in color 500 100 Turtles are green in color 500 100 Turtles are green in color meaning that uh 20% of the turtles are meaning that uh 20% of the turtles are meaning that uh 20% of the turtles are green in color and 50 out of 500 turtles green in color and 50 out of 500 turtles green in color and 50 out of 500 turtles have sharp teeth right so that's what we have sharp teeth right so that's what we have sharp teeth right so that's what we understand from this data set now the understand from this data set now the understand from this data set now the problem here is we given a observation problem here is we given a observation problem here is we given a observation over here okay we given some value for over here okay we given some value for over here okay we given some value for swim Wings Green and sharp teeth what we swim Wings Green and sharp teeth what we swim Wings Green and sharp teeth what we need to do is we need to predict whether need to do is we need to predict whether need to do is we need to predict whether the animal is a cat parrot or a turtle the animal is a cat parrot or a turtle the animal is a cat parrot or a turtle based on these values right so the goal based on these values right so the goal based on these values right so the goal here is to predict whether it is a cat here is to predict whether it is a cat here is to predict whether it is a cat parrot or a turtle based on all these parrot or a turtle based on all these parrot or a turtle based on all these defined parameters okay based on the defined parameters okay based on the defined parameters okay based on the value of swim Wings Green and sharp value of swim Wings Green and sharp value of swim Wings Green and sharp teeth we'll understand whether the teeth we'll understand whether the teeth we'll understand whether the animal is a cat or is it a parrot or is animal is a cat or is it a parrot or is animal is a cat or is it a parrot or is it a turtle so if you look at the it a turtle so if you look at the it a turtle so if you look at the observation the variables swim and green observation the variables swim and green observation the variables swim and green have a value of true right and the have a value of true right and the have a value of true right and the outcome can be any one of the types it outcome can be any one of the types it outcome can be any one of the types it can either be a cat it can be a parrot can either be a cat it can be a parrot can either be a cat it can be a parrot or it can be a turtle so in order to or it can be a turtle so in order to or it can be a turtle so in order to check if the animal is a cat all you check if the animal is a cat all you check if the animal is a cat all you have to do is you have to calculate the have to do is you have to calculate the have to do is you have to calculate the conditional probability at each step so conditional probability at each step so conditional probability at each step so here what we're doing is we need to here what we're doing is we need to here what we're doing is we need to calculate the probability that this is a calculate the probability that this is a calculate the probability that this is a cat given that it can swim and it is cat given that it can swim and it is cat given that it can swim and it is green in color first we'll calculate the green in color first we'll calculate the green in color first we'll calculate the probability that it can swim given that probability that it can swim given that probability that it can swim given that it's a cat into the probability that it it's a cat into the probability that it it's a cat into the probability that it is green and the probability of it being is green and the probability of it being is green and the probability of it being green given that it is a cat and then green given that it is a cat and then green given that it is a cat and then we'll multiply it with the probability we'll multiply it with the probability we'll multiply it with the probability of it being a cat divided by the of it being a cat divided by the of it being a cat divided by the probability of swim and green okay so probability of swim and green okay so probability of swim and green okay so guys I know you can calculate the guys I know you can calculate the guys I know you can calculate the probability it's quite simple so once probability it's quite simple so once probability it's quite simple so once you calculate the probability here you calculate the probability here you calculate the probability here you'll get a direct value of zero okay you'll get a direct value of zero okay you'll get a direct value of zero okay you'll get a value of zero meaning that you'll get a value of zero meaning that you'll get a value of zero meaning that this animal is definitely not a cat this animal is definitely not a cat this animal is definitely not a cat similarly if you do this for p you similarly if you do this for p you similarly if you do this for p you calculate the conditional probability calculate the conditional probability calculate the conditional probability you'll get a value of you'll get a value of you'll get a value of 0.264 divided by probability of swim 0.264 divided by probability of swim 0.264 divided by probability of swim comma green right we don't know this comma green right we don't know this comma green right we don't know this probability similarly if you check this probability similarly if you check this probability similarly if you check this for the turtle you'll get a probability for the turtle you'll get a probability for the turtle you'll get a probability of 0.066 divided by P swim comma green of 0.066 divided by P swim comma green of 0.066 divided by P swim comma green okay now for these calculations the okay now for these calculations the okay now for these calculations the denominator is the same right the value denominator is the same right the value denominator is the same right the value of the denominator is the same and the of the denominator is the same and the of the denominator is the same and the value of and the probability of of it value of and the probability of of it value of and the probability of of it being a turtle is greater than that of a being a turtle is greater than that of a being a turtle is greater than that of a parrot right so that's how we can parrot right so that's how we can parrot right so that's how we can correctly predict that the animal is correctly predict that the animal is correctly predict that the animal is actually a turtle all right so guys this actually a turtle all right so guys this actually a turtle all right so guys this is how knife bias works you basically is how knife bias works you basically is how knife bias works you basically calculate the conditional probability at calculate the conditional probability at calculate the conditional probability at each step whatever classification needs each step whatever classification needs each step whatever classification needs to be done that has to be calculated to be done that has to be calculated to be done that has to be calculated through probability there's a lot of through probability there's a lot of through probability there's a lot of statistic that comes into knif bias and statistic that comes into knif bias and statistic that comes into knif bias and if youall want to learn more about if youall want to learn more about if youall want to learn more about statistics and probability I'll

so now let's move on and look at our next let's move on and look at our next let's move on and look at our next algorithm which is the K nearest algorithm which is the K nearest algorithm which is the K nearest neighbor neighbor neighbor algorithm now KNN which basically stands algorithm now KNN which basically stands algorithm now KNN which basically stands for K nearest neighbor is again a for K nearest neighbor is again a for K nearest neighbor is again a supervised classification algorithm that supervised classification algorithm that supervised classification algorithm that classifies a new new data point into the classifies a new new data point into the classifies a new new data point into the target class or the output class target class or the output class target class or the output class depending on the features of its depending on the features of its depending on the features of its neighboring data points right that's why neighboring data points right that's why neighboring data points right that's why it's called K nearest neighbor so let's it's called K nearest neighbor so let's it's called K nearest neighbor so let's try to understand KNN with a small try to understand KNN with a small try to understand KNN with a small analogy okay let's say that we want a analogy okay let's say that we want a analogy okay let's say that we want a machine to distinguish between the machine to distinguish between the machine to distinguish between the images of cats and dogs so to do this we images of cats and dogs so to do this we images of cats and dogs so to do this we must input a data set of cat and dog must input a data set of cat and dog must input a data set of cat and dog images and we have to train a model to images and we have to train a model to images and we have to train a model to detect the animal based on certain detect the animal based on certain detect the animal based on certain features okay for example features such features okay for example features such features okay for example features such as pointy ears can be used to identify as pointy ears can be used to identify as pointy ears can be used to identify cats right similarly we can identify cats right similarly we can identify cats right similarly we can identify dogs based on their long years so after dogs based on their long years so after dogs based on their long years so after studying the data set during the studying the data set during the studying the data set during the training phase when a new image is given training phase when a new image is given training phase when a new image is given to the model the KE and algorithm will to the model the KE and algorithm will to the model the KE and algorithm will classify it into either cats or dogs classify it into either cats or dogs classify it into either cats or dogs depending on the similarity in their depending on the similarity in their depending on the similarity in their features okay let's say that a new image features okay let's say that a new image features okay let's say that a new image has pointy ears it would classify that has pointy ears it would classify that has pointy ears it would classify that image as cat because it is similar to image as cat because it is similar to image as cat because it is similar to the cat image es because it's similar to the cat image es because it's similar to the cat image es because it's similar to its neighbors in this manner the KNN its neighbors in this manner the KNN its neighbors in this manner the KNN algorithm classifies the data points algorithm classifies the data points algorithm classifies the data points based on how similar they are to their based on how similar they are to their based on how similar they are to their neighboring data points right so this is neighboring data points right so this is neighboring data points right so this is a small example we'll discuss more about a small example we'll discuss more about a small example we'll discuss more about it in the further slides now let me tell it in the further slides now let me tell it in the further slides now let me tell you a couple of features of KNN you a couple of features of KNN you a couple of features of KNN algorithm so first of all we know that algorithm so first of all we know that algorithm so first of all we know that it is a supervised learning algorithm it it is a supervised learning algorithm it it is a supervised learning algorithm it uses labeled input data set to predict uses labeled input data set to predict uses labeled input data set to predict the output of the data points then it is the output of the data points then it is the output of the data points then it is also one of the simplest machine also one of the simplest machine also one of the simplest machine learning algorithms and it can be easily learning algorithms and it can be easily learning algorithms and it can be easily implemented for a varied set of problems implemented for a varied set of problems implemented for a varied set of problems another feature is that it is another feature is that it is another feature is that it is non-parametric meaning that it does not non-parametric meaning that it does not non-parametric meaning that it does not take in any assumptions for example take in any assumptions for example take in any assumptions for example knife bias is a parametric model because knife bias is a parametric model because knife bias is a parametric model because it assumes that all the independent it assumes that all the independent it assumes that all the independent variables are in no way related to each variables are in no way related to each variables are in no way related to each other right it has assumptions about the other right it has assumptions about the other right it has assumptions about the model K's neighbor has no such model K's neighbor has no such model K's neighbor has no such assumptions that's why it's considered a assumptions that's why it's considered a assumptions that's why it's considered a non-parametric model another feature is non-parametric model another feature is non-parametric model another feature is that it is a lazy algorithm that it is a lazy algorithm that it is a lazy algorithm now lazy algorithm basically is any now lazy algorithm basically is any now lazy algorithm basically is any algorithm that memorizes the training algorithm that memorizes the training algorithm that memorizes the training set instead of learning a discriminative set instead of learning a discriminative set instead of learning a discriminative function from the training data okay now function from the training data okay now function from the training data okay now even though knnn is mainly a even though knnn is mainly a even though knnn is mainly a classification algorithm it can also be classification algorithm it can also be classification algorithm it can also be used for regression cases right so KNN used for regression cases right so KNN used for regression cases right so KNN is actually both a classification and a is actually both a classification and a is actually both a classification and a regression algorithm but mostly you'll regression algorithm but mostly you'll regression algorithm but mostly you'll see that it'll be used only for see that it'll be used only for see that it'll be used only for classification problems the most classification problems the most classification problems the most important Fe feature about Karis important Fe feature about Karis important Fe feature about Karis neighbor is that it's based on feature neighbor is that it's based on feature neighbor is that it's based on feature similarity with its neighboring data similarity with its neighboring data similarity with its neighboring data points all right you'll understand this points all right you'll understand this points all right you'll understand this in the example that I'm going to tell in the example that I'm going to tell in the example that I'm going to tell you now in this image we have two you now in this image we have two you now in this image we have two classes of data right we have class A classes of data right we have class A classes of data right we have class A which is squares and Class B which are which is squares and Class B which are which is squares and Class B which are triangles now the problem statement is triangles now the problem statement is triangles now the problem statement is to assign the new input data point to to assign the new input data point to to assign the new input data point to one of the two classes by using the KNN one of the two classes by using the KNN one of the two classes by using the KNN algorithm so the first step in the KNN algorithm so the first step in the KNN algorithm so the first step in the KNN algorithm is to define the value of K algorithm is to define the value of K algorithm is to define the value of K but what does the K in the KNN algorithm but what does the K in the KNN algorithm but what does the K in the KNN algorithm stand for now the K stands for the stand for now the K stands for the stand for now the K stands for the number of nearest neighbors and that's number of nearest neighbors and that's number of nearest neighbors and that's why it's got the name k nearest why it's got the name k nearest why it's got the name k nearest neighbors right now in this image I've neighbors right now in this image I've neighbors right now in this image I've defined the value of K as three this defined the value of K as three this defined the value of K as three this means that the algorithm will consider means that the algorithm will consider means that the algorithm will consider the three neighbors that are closest to the three neighbors that are closest to the three neighbors that are closest to the new data point in order to decide the new data point in order to decide the new data point in order to decide the class of the new data point so the the class of the new data point so the the class of the new data point so the closest between the data point is closest between the data point is closest between the data point is calculated by using measure such as ukan calculated by using measure such as ukan calculated by using measure such as ukan distance and Manhattan distance which distance and Manhattan distance which distance and Manhattan distance which I'll be explaining in a while so at K is I'll be explaining in a while so at K is I'll be explaining in a while so at K is equal to 3 the neighbors include two equal to 3 the neighbors include two equal to 3 the neighbors include two squares and one triangle so if I were to squares and one triangle so if I were to squares and one triangle so if I were to classify the new data point based on k classify the new data point based on k classify the new data point based on k equal to 3 then it should be assigned to equal to 3 then it should be assigned to equal to 3 then it should be assigned to class a correct it should be assigned to class a correct it should be assigned to class a correct it should be assigned to squares but what if the K value is set squares but what if the K value is set squares but what if the K value is set to seven here I'm basically telling my to seven here I'm basically telling my to seven here I'm basically telling my algorithm to look for the seven nearest algorithm to look for the seven nearest algorithm to look for the seven nearest neighbors and classify the new data neighbors and classify the new data neighbors and classify the new data point into the class it is most similar point into the class it is most similar point into the class it is most similar to right so at k equal to 7 the to right so at k equal to 7 the to right so at k equal to 7 the neighbors include three squares and four neighbors include three squares and four neighbors include three squares and four triangles so if I were to classify the triangles so if I were to classify the triangles so if I were to classify the new data point based on k equal to 7 new data point based on k equal to 7 new data point based on k equal to 7 then it would be assigned to class B then it would be assigned to class B then it would be assigned to class B Since U majority of its neighbors are Since U majority of its neighbors are Since U majority of its neighbors are from class B now this is where a lot of from class B now this is where a lot of from class B now this is where a lot of us get confused right so how do we know us get confused right so how do we know us get confused right so how do we know which K value is the most suitable for which K value is the most suitable for which K value is the most suitable for K's neighbor now there are a couple of K's neighbor now there are a couple of K's neighbor now there are a couple of methods used to calculate the K value methods used to calculate the K value methods used to calculate the K value one of them is known as the elbow elow one of them is known as the elbow elow one of them is known as the elbow elow method right we'll be discussing the method right we'll be discussing the method right we'll be discussing the elbow method in the upcoming slides okay elbow method in the upcoming slides okay elbow method in the upcoming slides okay so for now let me just show you uh the so for now let me just show you uh the so for now let me just show you uh the measures that are involved behind K&amp;N measures that are involved behind K&amp;N measures that are involved behind K&amp;N okay there's very simple math behind the okay there's very simple math behind the okay there's very simple math behind the korus neighbor algorithm so I'll be korus neighbor algorithm so I'll be korus neighbor algorithm so I'll be discussing the ukan distance with you discussing the ukan distance with you discussing the ukan distance with you now in this figure we have to measure now in this figure we have to measure now in this figure we have to measure the distance between P1 and P2 by using the distance between P1 and P2 by using the distance between P1 and P2 by using ukan distance I'm sure a lot of you ukan distance I'm sure a lot of you ukan distance I'm sure a lot of you already know what ukan distance is it is already know what ukan distance is it is already know what ukan distance is it is something that we learned in eth or 10th something that we learned in eth or 10th something that we learned in eth or 10th grade I'm not sure right so all you're grade I'm not sure right so all you're grade I'm not sure right so all you're doing is you're extracting X1 so the doing is you're extracting X1 so the doing is you're extracting X1 so the formula is basically X2 - X1 the whole s formula is basically X2 - X1 the whole s formula is basically X2 - X1 the whole s + Y2 - y1 the whole square and the root + Y2 - y1 the whole square and the root + Y2 - y1 the whole square and the root of that is your ukian distance right of that is your ukian distance right of that is your ukian distance right it's as simple as that so ukian distance it's as simple as that so ukian distance it's as simple as that so ukian distance is used as a measure to check the is used as a measure to check the is used as a measure to check the closeness of data points right so closeness of data points right so closeness of data points right so basically KNN uses the ukan distance to basically KNN uses the ukan distance to basically KNN uses the ukan distance to check the closeness of a new data point check the closeness of a new data point check the closeness of a new data point with its neighbors so guys it's as with its neighbors so guys it's as with its neighbors so guys it's as simple as that Cann makes use of simple simple as that Cann makes use of simple simple as that Cann makes use of simple measures in order to solve very complex measures in order to solve very complex measures in order to solve very complex problems okay this is one of the reasons problems okay this is one of the reasons problems okay this is one of the reasons why KNN is such a commonly used why KNN is such a commonly used why KNN is such a commonly used algorithm coming to support Vector algorithm coming to support Vector algorithm coming to support Vector machines now this is our last algorithm machines now this is our last algorithm machines now this is our last algorithm under classification algorithms now guys under classification algorithms now guys under classification algorithms now guys don't get paranoid because of the name don't get paranoid because of the name don't get paranoid because of the name support Vector machine actually is one support Vector machine actually is one support Vector machine actually is one of the simplest algorithms in supervised of the simplest algorithms in supervised of the simplest algorithms in supervised learning okay it is basically used to learning okay it is basically used to learning okay it is basically used to classify data into different classes classify data into different classes classify data into different classes right it's a classification algorithm right it's a classification algorithm right it's a classification algorithm now unlike most algorithms spvm makes now unlike most algorithms spvm makes now unlike most algorithms spvm makes use of something known as a hyper plane use of something known as a hyper plane use of something known as a hyper plane which acts like a decision boundary which acts like a decision boundary which acts like a decision boundary between the separate classes okay now between the separate classes okay now between the separate classes okay now svm can be used to generate multiple svm can be used to generate multiple svm can be used to generate multiple separating hyperplanes such that the separating hyperplanes such that the separating hyperplanes such that the data is divided into segments and each data is divided into segments and each data is divided into segments and each segment contains only one kind of data segment contains only one kind of data segment contains only one kind of data so a few features of svm include that it so a few features of svm include that it so a few features of svm include that it is a supervised learning algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm meaning that it's going to study a meaning that it's going to study a meaning that it's going to study a labeled training data another feature is labeled training data another feature is labeled training data another feature is that it is again a regression and a that it is again a regression and a that it is again a regression and a classification algorithm even though classification algorithm even though classification algorithm even though spvm is mainly used for classification spvm is mainly used for classification spvm is mainly used for classification there is something known as the support there is something known as the support there is something known as the support Vector regressor right that is used for Vector regressor right that is used for Vector regressor right that is used for regression problems now svm can also be regression problems now svm can also be regression problems now svm can also be used to classify nonlinear data by using used to classify nonlinear data by using used to classify nonlinear data by using kernel dcks nonlinear data is basically kernel dcks nonlinear data is basically kernel dcks nonlinear data is basically data that cannot be separated by using a data that cannot be separated by using a data that cannot be separated by using a single linear line I'll be talking more single linear line I'll be talking more single linear line I'll be talking more about this in the upcoming slides now about this in the upcoming slides now about this in the upcoming slides now let's move on and discuss how svm works let's move on and discuss how svm works let's move on and discuss how svm works now again in order to make you now again in order to make you now again in order to make you understand how support Vector machine understand how support Vector machine understand how support Vector machine works we look at a small scenario okay works we look at a small scenario okay works we look at a small scenario okay for a second pretend that you own a farm for a second pretend that you own a farm for a second pretend that you own a farm and you have a problem okay you need to and you have a problem okay you need to and you have a problem okay you need to set up a fence to protect your rabbits set up a fence to protect your rabbits set up a fence to protect your rabbits from a pack of wolves okay now you need from a pack of wolves okay now you need from a pack of wolves okay now you need to decide where you want to build your to decide where you want to build your to decide where you want to build your fence so one way to solve the problem is fence so one way to solve the problem is fence so one way to solve the problem is by using support Vector machines right by using support Vector machines right by using support Vector machines right so if I do that and if I try to draw a so if I do that and if I try to draw a so if I do that and if I try to draw a decision boundary between the rabbits decision boundary between the rabbits decision boundary between the rabbits and the Wolves it looks something like and the Wolves it looks something like and the Wolves it looks something like this right now you can clearly build a this right now you can clearly build a this right now you can clearly build a fence along this line so in simple terms fence along this line so in simple terms fence along this line so in simple terms this is exactly how your support Vector this is exactly how your support Vector this is exactly how your support Vector machines work it draws a decision machines work it draws a decision machines work it draws a decision boundary which is nothing but a hyper boundary which is nothing but a hyper boundary which is nothing but a hyper plane between any two classes in order plane between any two classes in order plane between any two classes in order to separate them or classify them now I to separate them or classify them now I to separate them or classify them now I know that you're thinking how do you know that you're thinking how do you know that you're thinking how do you know where to draw a hyperplane now the know where to draw a hyperplane now the know where to draw a hyperplane now the basic principle behind svm is to draw a basic principle behind svm is to draw a basic principle behind svm is to draw a hyper plane that best separates the two hyper plane that best separates the two hyper plane that best separates the two classes in our case the two classes are classes in our case the two classes are classes in our case the two classes are the rabbits and the Wolves all right now the rabbits and the Wolves all right now the rabbits and the Wolves all right now before we move any further let's discuss before we move any further let's discuss before we move any further let's discuss the different terminologies that are the different terminologies that are the different terminologies that are there in support Vector machines so that there in support Vector machines so that there in support Vector machines so that is basically a hyperplane it is a is basically a hyperplane it is a is basically a hyperplane it is a decision boundary that best separates decision boundary that best separates decision boundary that best separates the two classes right now support the two classes right now support the two classes right now support vectors what exactly are support vectors vectors what exactly are support vectors vectors what exactly are support vectors so when you start with the support so when you start with the support so when you start with the support Vector machine you start by drawing a Vector machine you start by drawing a Vector machine you start by drawing a random hyper plane and then you check random hyper plane and then you check random hyper plane and then you check the distance between the hyper plane and the distance between the hyper plane and the distance between the hyper plane and the closest data points from each of the the closest data points from each of the the closest data points from each of the class right these closest data points to class right these closest data points to class right these closest data points to the hyper plane are known as support the hyper plane are known as support the hyper plane are known as support vectors right these two data points are vectors right these two data points are vectors right these two data points are the closest to your hyper plane so these the closest to your hyper plane so these the closest to your hyper plane so these are known as support vectors and that's are known as support vectors and that's are known as support vectors and that's where the name comes from support Vector where the name comes from support Vector where the name comes from support Vector machines now the hyper plane is drawn machines now the hyper plane is drawn machines now the hyper plane is drawn based on these support vectors and uh an based on these support vectors and uh an based on these support vectors and uh an Optimum hyper plane will be the one Optimum hyper plane will be the one Optimum hyper plane will be the one which has a maximum distance from each which has a maximum distance from each which has a maximum distance from each of the support vectors meaning that the of the support vectors meaning that the of the support vectors meaning that the distance between the hyperplane and the distance between the hyperplane and the distance between the hyperplane and the support vectors has to be maximum right support vectors has to be maximum right support vectors has to be maximum right so to Summit up spvm is used to classify so to Summit up spvm is used to classify so to Summit up spvm is used to classify data by using a hyper plane such that data by using a hyper plane such that data by using a hyper plane such that the distance between the hyper plane and the distance between the hyper plane and the distance between the hyper plane and the support Vector is maximum now this the support Vector is maximum now this the support Vector is maximum now this distance is nothing but the margin now distance is nothing but the margin now distance is nothing but the margin now let's try to solve a problem right let's let's try to solve a problem right let's let's try to solve a problem right let's say that I input a new data point and I say that I input a new data point and I say that I input a new data point and I want to draw a hyper plane such that it want to draw a hyper plane such that it want to draw a hyper plane such that it best separates these two classes so what best separates these two classes so what best separates these two classes so what do I do I start off by drawing a hyper do I do I start off by drawing a hyper do I do I start off by drawing a hyper plane and then I check the distance plane and then I check the distance plane and then I check the distance between the hyper plane and the support between the hyper plane and the support between the hyper plane and the support vectors so basically here I'm trying to vectors so basically here I'm trying to vectors so basically here I'm trying to check if the margin is maximum for this check if the margin is maximum for this check if the margin is maximum for this hyper plane but what if I drew the hyper hyper plane but what if I drew the hyper hyper plane but what if I drew the hyper plane like this the margin for this plane like this the margin for this plane like this the margin for this hyper plane is clearly way more than the hyper plane is clearly way more than the hyper plane is clearly way more than the previous one so this is my optimal previous one so this is my optimal previous one so this is my optimal hyperplane right this is exactly how you hyperplane right this is exactly how you hyperplane right this is exactly how you understand which hyper plane needs to be understand which hyper plane needs to be understand which hyper plane needs to be chosen because you can from multiple chosen because you can from multiple chosen because you can from multiple hyperplanes now the best hyper plane is hyperplanes now the best hyper plane is hyperplanes now the best hyper plane is the one that has a maximum margin so the one that has a maximum margin so the one that has a maximum margin so this is my optimal hyper plane now so this is my optimal hyper plane now so this is my optimal hyper plane now so far it was quite easy right our data was far it was quite easy right our data was far it was quite easy right our data was linearly separable which means that you linearly separable which means that you linearly separable which means that you could draw a straight line to separate could draw a straight line to separate could draw a straight line to separate the two classes but what will you do if the two classes but what will you do if the two classes but what will you do if the data looks like this you possibly the data looks like this you possibly the data looks like this you possibly cannot draw a hyperplane like this you cannot draw a hyperplane like this you cannot draw a hyperplane like this you possibly cannot draw a hyper plane like possibly cannot draw a hyper plane like possibly cannot draw a hyper plane like this right it doesn't separate the two this right it doesn't separate the two this right it doesn't separate the two classes we you can clearly see rabbits classes we you can clearly see rabbits classes we you can clearly see rabbits and wolves in both of the classes now and wolves in both of the classes now and wolves in both of the classes now this is exactly where nonlinear spvm this is exactly where nonlinear spvm this is exactly where nonlinear spvm comes into the picture okay this is what comes into the picture okay this is what comes into the picture okay this is what the kernel trick is all about now kernel the kernel trick is all about now kernel the kernel trick is all about now kernel is basically uh something that can be is basically uh something that can be is basically uh something that can be used to transform data into another used to transform data into another used to transform data into another dimension that has a clear dividing dimension that has a clear dividing dimension that has a clear dividing margin between classes of data so margin between classes of data so margin between classes of data so basically the kernel function offers the basically the kernel function offers the basically the kernel function offers the user the option of transforming user the option of transforming user the option of transforming nonlinear spaces into linear ones so nonlinear spaces into linear ones so nonlinear spaces into linear ones so until this point if you notice that we until this point if you notice that we until this point if you notice that we were plotting our data on two were plotting our data on two were plotting our data on two dimensional space right we had X and Y dimensional space right we had X and Y dimensional space right we had X and Y AIS a simple trick is transforming the AIS a simple trick is transforming the AIS a simple trick is transforming the two variables X and Y into a new feature two variables X and Y into a new feature two variables X and Y into a new feature space which involves a new variable Zed space which involves a new variable Zed space which involves a new variable Zed so basically what we're doing is we're so basically what we're doing is we're so basically what we're doing is we're visualizing the data on a visualizing the data on a visualizing the data on a three-dimensional space so when you three-dimensional space so when you three-dimensional space so when you transform the 2D space into a 3D space transform the 2D space into a 3D space transform the 2D space into a 3D space you can clearly see a dividing margin you can clearly see a dividing margin you can clearly see a dividing margin between the two classes of data right between the two classes of data right between the two classes of data right you can clearly draw a line in the you can clearly draw a line in the you can clearly draw a line in the middle that separates these two data middle that separates these two data middle that separates these two data

have 16 lemons we have only five mandarins and we have 19 oranges all mandarins and we have 19 oranges all mandarins and we have 19 oranges all right even though the number of Mandarin right even though the number of Mandarin right even though the number of Mandarin samples is low we'll have to work with samples is low we'll have to work with samples is low we'll have to work with it because right now I'm just trying to it because right now I'm just trying to it because right now I'm just trying to make you understand the classification make you understand the classification make you understand the classification algorithms right the main aim for me algorithms right the main aim for me algorithms right the main aim for me behind uh doing these demos is so that behind uh doing these demos is so that behind uh doing these demos is so that you understand how classification a you understand how classification a you understand how classification a algorithms work now what you can do is algorithms work now what you can do is algorithms work now what you can do is you can also plot a graph in order to you can also plot a graph in order to you can also plot a graph in order to see the frequency of each of these see the frequency of each of these see the frequency of each of these fruits okay I'll show you what the plot fruits okay I'll show you what the plot fruits okay I'll show you what the plot looks like right the number of apples looks like right the number of apples looks like right the number of apples and oranges is the same right we have I and oranges is the same right we have I and oranges is the same right we have I think around 19 apples and oranges and think around 19 apples and oranges and think around 19 apples and oranges and similarly this is the count for lemons similarly this is the count for lemons similarly this is the count for lemons okay so this a small visualization guys okay so this a small visualization guys okay so this a small visualization guys visualization is actually very important visualization is actually very important visualization is actually very important when it comes to machine learning when it comes to machine learning when it comes to machine learning because you can see most of the because you can see most of the because you can see most of the relations and correlations by plotting relations and correlations by plotting relations and correlations by plotting graphs right you can't see those graphs right you can't see those graphs right you can't see those correlations by just you know running correlations by just you know running correlations by just you know running code and all of that only when you plot code and all of that only when you plot code and all of that only when you plot different variables on your graph you'll different variables on your graph you'll different variables on your graph you'll understand how they are related one of understand how they are related one of understand how they are related one of the main tasks in machine learning is to the main tasks in machine learning is to the main tasks in machine learning is to visualize data right it ensures that you visualize data right it ensures that you visualize data right it ensures that you understand the correlation between understand the correlation between understand the correlation between data next what we're going to do is data next what we're going to do is data next what we're going to do is we'll graph something known as a box we'll graph something known as a box we'll graph something known as a box plot okay a box plot is basically helps plot okay a box plot is basically helps plot okay a box plot is basically helps you understand the distribution of your you understand the distribution of your you understand the distribution of your data right let me uh run the box plot data right let me uh run the box plot data right let me uh run the box plot and I'll show you what exactly I and I'll show you what exactly I and I'll show you what exactly I mean right so this is our box plot so mean right so this is our box plot so mean right so this is our box plot so box plot will basically give you a box plot will basically give you a box plot will basically give you a clearer idea of the distribution of your clearer idea of the distribution of your clearer idea of the distribution of your input variables okay it is mainly used input variables okay it is mainly used input variables okay it is mainly used in exploratory data analysis and it in exploratory data analysis and it in exploratory data analysis and it represents the distribution of the data represents the distribution of the data represents the distribution of the data and its variability now the box plot and its variability now the box plot and its variability now the box plot contains upper quartile and lower contains upper quartile and lower contains upper quartile and lower quartiles so the box plot basically quartiles so the box plot basically quartiles so the box plot basically spans your inter quartile range or spans your inter quartile range or spans your inter quartile range or something known as IQR IQR is nothing something known as IQR IQR is nothing something known as IQR IQR is nothing but your third quartile subtracted from but your third quartile subtracted from but your third quartile subtracted from your first quartile now again this your first quartile now again this your first quartile now again this involves statistics and probability so involves statistics and probability so involves statistics and probability so I'll be leaving a link in the I'll be leaving a link in the I'll be leaving a link in the description box you can go through that description box you can go through that description box you can go through that video I've explained statistics video I've explained statistics video I've explained statistics probability IQR range and all of that in probability IQR range and all of that in probability IQR range and all of that in that right so one of the main reasons that right so one of the main reasons that right so one of the main reasons why box plots are used is to detect any why box plots are used is to detect any why box plots are used is to detect any sort of outliers in the data right since sort of outliers in the data right since sort of outliers in the data right since the box plot spans the IQR it detects the box plot spans the IQR it detects the box plot spans the IQR it detects the data points that lie outside the the data points that lie outside the the data points that lie outside the average range so if you see in the color average range so if you see in the color average range so if you see in the color space most of the data is distributed space most of the data is distributed space most of the data is distributed around the IQR right whereas here the around the IQR right whereas here the around the IQR right whereas here the data is not that well distributed height data is not that well distributed height data is not that well distributed height also is not very well distributed but also is not very well distributed but also is not very well distributed but color space is pretty well distributed color space is pretty well distributed color space is pretty well distributed right this is what the box plot shows right this is what the box plot shows right this is what the box plot shows you so guys this involves a lot of math you so guys this involves a lot of math you so guys this involves a lot of math right all of these each and every right all of these each and every right all of these each and every function in machine learning involves a function in machine learning involves a function in machine learning involves a lot of math so you know it's necessary lot of math so you know it's necessary lot of math so you know it's necessary to have a good understanding of to have a good understanding of to have a good understanding of Statistics probability and all of that Statistics probability and all of that Statistics probability and all of that right now next what we'll do is we'll right now next what we'll do is we'll right now next what we'll do is we'll plot a histogram histogram will plot a histogram histogram will plot a histogram histogram will basically show you the frequency of basically show you the frequency of basically show you the frequency of occurrence right let me just plot this occurrence right let me just plot this occurrence right let me just plot this and then we'll try and understand so here you can understand a understand so here you can understand a few correlations okay some pairs of few correlations okay some pairs of few correlations okay some pairs of these attributes are correlated for these attributes are correlated for these attributes are correlated for example mass and width right they're example mass and width right they're example mass and width right they're somehow correlated along the same ranges somehow correlated along the same ranges somehow correlated along the same ranges right so this suggests a high right so this suggests a high right so this suggests a high correlation and a predictable correlation and a predictable correlation and a predictable relationship like if you look at their relationship like if you look at their relationship like if you look at their graphs they're quite similar right so graphs they're quite similar right so graphs they're quite similar right so for each of the predictive variables for each of the predictive variables for each of the predictive variables I've drawn a histogram right for each of I've drawn a histogram right for each of I've drawn a histogram right for each of that input data we've drawn a histogram that input data we've drawn a histogram that input data we've drawn a histogram now guys again like I said plotting now guys again like I said plotting now guys again like I said plotting graphs is very important because you graphs is very important because you graphs is very important because you understand a lot of correlations that understand a lot of correlations that understand a lot of correlations that you cannot understand by just looking at you cannot understand by just looking at you cannot understand by just looking at your data right or just running your data right or just running your data right or just running operations on your data repeat or just operations on your data repeat or just operations on your data repeat or just running code on your data okay now next running code on your data okay now next running code on your data okay now next what we're doing here is we're just what we're doing here is we're just what we're doing here is we're just dividing the data set into Target and dividing the data set into Target and dividing the data set into Target and predictor variables right so basically predictor variables right so basically predictor variables right so basically you've created an array of feature names you've created an array of feature names you've created an array of feature names which has your predictor variables right which has your predictor variables right which has your predictor variables right it has mass width height color space and it has mass width height color space and it has mass width height color space and you have assigned that as X since this you have assigned that as X since this you have assigned that as X since this is your input and Y is your output which is your input and Y is your output which is your input and Y is your output which is your fruit label that is it'll show is your fruit label that is it'll show is your fruit label that is it'll show whether it is an apple orange lemon and whether it is an apple orange lemon and whether it is an apple orange lemon and so on now the next step that we've so on now the next step that we've so on now the next step that we've performed over here is pretty evident performed over here is pretty evident performed over here is pretty evident all right again this is data splicing so all right again this is data splicing so all right again this is data splicing so data splicing by now I'm sure all of you data splicing by now I'm sure all of you data splicing by now I'm sure all of you know what it is it is splitting your know what it is it is splitting your know what it is it is splitting your data into training and testing data so data into training and testing data so data into training and testing data so that's what we've done over here next we that's what we've done over here next we that's what we've done over here next we are importing something known as the are importing something known as the are importing something known as the minmax scaler scaling or normalizing minmax scaler scaling or normalizing minmax scaler scaling or normalizing your data is very important in machine your data is very important in machine your data is very important in machine learning now I'm saying this because learning now I'm saying this because learning now I'm saying this because your raw data can be very biased right your raw data can be very biased right your raw data can be very biased right so it's very important to normalize your so it's very important to normalize your so it's very important to normalize your data now when I say normalize your data data now when I say normalize your data data now when I say normalize your data so if you look at the value of mass and so if you look at the value of mass and so if you look at the value of mass and if you look at the value of height and if you look at the value of height and if you look at the value of height and color you see that mass is ranging in color you see that mass is ranging in color you see that mass is ranging in 100s and you know double digits whereas 100s and you know double digits whereas 100s and you know double digits whereas height is in single digits and color height is in single digits and color height is in single digits and color score is not even in single digits so if score is not even in single digits so if score is not even in single digits so if some of your variables have a very high some of your variables have a very high some of your variables have a very high range right you know they have a very range right you know they have a very range right you know they have a very high scale like they're in two digits or high scale like they're in two digits or high scale like they're in two digits or three digits whereas other variables are three digits whereas other variables are three digits whereas other variables are single digits and lesser then your single digits and lesser then your single digits and lesser then your output is going to be very biased right output is going to be very biased right output is going to be very biased right it's obvious that it's going to be very it's obvious that it's going to be very it's obvious that it's going to be very device that's why you have to scale your device that's why you have to scale your device that's why you have to scale your data in such a way that all of these data in such a way that all of these data in such a way that all of these values will have a similar range right values will have a similar range right values will have a similar range right so that's exactly what the scaler so that's exactly what the scaler so that's exactly what the scaler function does okay now since we have function does okay now since we have function does okay now since we have already divided our data into training already divided our data into training already divided our data into training and testing data our next step is to and testing data our next step is to and testing data our next step is to build the model right so first we're build the model right so first we're build the model right so first we're going to be using the logistic going to be using the logistic going to be using the logistic regression algorithm right I already regression algorithm right I already regression algorithm right I already discussed logistic regression with you discussed logistic regression with you discussed logistic regression with you all it's a classification algorithm all it's a classification algorithm all it's a classification algorithm which is basically used to predict the which is basically used to predict the which is basically used to predict the outcome of a categorical variable right outcome of a categorical variable right outcome of a categorical variable right so we already have the logistic so we already have the logistic so we already have the logistic regression class in Python all you have regression class in Python all you have regression class in Python all you have to do is you have to give an instance to do is you have to give an instance to do is you have to give an instance for this function which is log reg over for this function which is log reg over for this function which is log reg over here and I'm fitting this instance with here and I'm fitting this instance with here and I'm fitting this instance with the training data set meaning that I'm the training data set meaning that I'm the training data set meaning that I'm running the algorithm with the training running the algorithm with the training running the algorithm with the training data set once you do that you can data set once you do that you can data set once you do that you can calculate the accuracy by using this calculate the accuracy by using this calculate the accuracy by using this function so here I'm calculating the function so here I'm calculating the function so here I'm calculating the accuracy on the training data set and on accuracy on the training data set and on accuracy on the training data set and on the testing data set set okay so let's the testing data set set okay so let's the testing data set set okay so let's look at the output of this now guys look at the output of this now guys look at the output of this now guys ignore this future warning right ignore this future warning right ignore this future warning right warnings are ignored in Python now warnings are ignored in Python now warnings are ignored in Python now accuracy of the logistic regression accuracy of the logistic regression accuracy of the logistic regression classifier on the training data set is classifier on the training data set is classifier on the training data set is around 70% which is pretty good on the around 70% which is pretty good on the around 70% which is pretty good on the training data set but when it comes to training data set but when it comes to training data set but when it comes to classifying on the test data set it's classifying on the test data set it's classifying on the test data set it's only 40% right which is not that good only 40% right which is not that good only 40% right which is not that good for a classifier now again this can for a classifier now again this can for a classifier now again this can depend on the problem statement right depend on the problem statement right depend on the problem statement right for which problem statement is logistic for which problem statement is logistic for which problem statement is logistic regression more suitable right next regression more suitable right next regression more suitable right next we'll do the same thing using the we'll do the same thing using the we'll do the same thing using the decision tree so again we'll just call decision tree so again we'll just call decision tree so again we'll just call the decision tree function and we'll fit the decision tree function and we'll fit the decision tree function and we'll fit it with a training data set we'll it with a training data set we'll it with a training data set we'll calculate the accuracy of the decision calculate the accuracy of the decision calculate the accuracy of the decision Tree on the training and the testing Tree on the training and the testing Tree on the training and the testing data set so if you do that for a data set so if you do that for a data set so if you do that for a decision Tree on the training data set decision Tree on the training data set decision Tree on the training data set you get a 100% accuracy right but on the you get a 100% accuracy right but on the you get a 100% accuracy right but on the testing data set you have around 87% of testing data set you have around 87% of testing data set you have around 87% of accuracy now this is something that I accuracy now this is something that I accuracy now this is something that I discussed with you all earlier that discussed with you all earlier that discussed with you all earlier that decision trees are very good with decision trees are very good with decision trees are very good with training data set because of a process training data set because of a process training data set because of a process known as overfitting right but when it known as overfitting right but when it known as overfitting right but when it comes to classifying the outcome on the comes to classifying the outcome on the comes to classifying the outcome on the testing data set the accuracy reduces testing data set the accuracy reduces testing data set the accuracy reduces now this is very good compared to now this is very good compared to now this is very good compared to logistic regression right for this logistic regression right for this logistic regression right for this problem statement decision trees works problem statement decision trees works problem statement decision trees works better than logistic regression coming better than logistic regression coming better than logistic regression coming to KNN classifier again all you have to to KNN classifier again all you have to to KNN classifier again all you have to do is you have to call the K neighbor do is you have to call the K neighbor do is you have to call the K neighbor classifier classifier classifier right this function and you have to fit right this function and you have to fit right this function and you have to fit this with the training data set if you this with the training data set if you this with the training data set if you calculate the accuracy for a Cann calculate the accuracy for a Cann calculate the accuracy for a Cann classifier we get a good accuracy classifier we get a good accuracy classifier we get a good accuracy actually on the training data set we get actually on the training data set we get actually on the training data set we get an accuracy of 95% and on the testing an accuracy of 95% and on the testing an accuracy of 95% and on the testing data set is 100% that is really good data set is 100% that is really good data set is 100% that is really good because our testing data set actually because our testing data set actually because our testing data set actually achieved more of an accuracy than on our achieved more of an accuracy than on our achieved more of an accuracy than on our training data set right now all of this training data set right now all of this training data set right now all of this depends on the value of K that you've depends on the value of K that you've depends on the value of K that you've chosen for K&amp;N now uh I mentioned that chosen for K&amp;N now uh I mentioned that chosen for K&amp;N now uh I mentioned that you use the elbow method to choose the you use the elbow method to choose the you use the elbow method to choose the key value in the K nearest neighbor I'll key value in the K nearest neighbor I'll key value in the K nearest neighbor I'll be discussing the elbow method in the be discussing the elbow method in the be discussing the elbow method in the next section right so don't worry if you next section right so don't worry if you next section right so don't worry if you haven't understood that yet now we're haven't understood that yet now we're haven't understood that yet now we're also using a knife bi classifier here also using a knife bi classifier here also using a knife bi classifier here we're using a goian knif b classifier we're using a goian knif b classifier we're using a goian knif b classifier goian is basically a type of knif B goian is basically a type of knif B goian is basically a type of knif B classifier right I'm not going to go classifier right I'm not going to go classifier right I'm not going to go into depth of this because it'll just into depth of this because it'll just into depth of this because it'll just extend our session to much more longer extend our session to much more longer extend our session to much more longer okay and if you want to know more about okay and if you want to know more about okay and if you want to know more about this I'll leave a link in the this I'll leave a link in the this I'll leave a link in the description box you can read all about description box you can read all about description box you can read all about the caution knif B classifier how the the caution knif B classifier how the the caution knif B classifier how the math behind this is the same right it's math behind this is the same right it's math behind this is the same right it's uses knif bias it uses the bias theorem uses knif bias it uses the bias theorem uses knif bias it uses the bias theorem itself now again we're going to call itself now again we're going to call itself now again we're going to call this class and then we're going to run this class and then we're going to run this class and then we're going to run our data training data on it right so our data training data on it right so our data training data on it right so using the knif bi classifier we're using the knif bi classifier we're using the knif bi classifier we're getting an accuracy of getting an accuracy of getting an accuracy of 0.86 on the training data set and on the 0.86 on the training data set and on the 0.86 on the training data set and on the testing data set we're getting a 67% testing data set we're getting a 67% testing data set we're getting a 67% accuracy accuracy accuracy okay now let's do the same thing with okay now let's do the same thing with okay now let's do the same thing with support Vector machines importing the support Vector machines importing the support Vector machines importing the support Vector classifier right and support Vector classifier right and support Vector classifier right and we're fitting the training data into the we're fitting the training data into the we're fitting the training data into the algorithm we're getting a accuracy of algorithm we're getting a accuracy of algorithm we're getting a accuracy of around 61% on the training data set and around 61% on the training data set and around 61% on the training data set and 33% on the testing data set now guys 33% on the testing data set now guys 33% on the testing data set now guys this accuracy and all depends also on this accuracy and all depends also on this accuracy and all depends also on the problem statement right it depends the problem statement right it depends the problem statement right it depends on the type of data that support Vector on the type of data that support Vector on the type of data that support Vector machines get usually svm is very good on machines get usually svm is very good on machines get usually svm is very good on large data sets now since we have a very large data sets now since we have a very large data sets now since we have a very small data set over here it's sort of small data set over here it's sort of small data set over here it's sort of obvious why the accuracy is so less so obvious why the accuracy is so less so obvious why the accuracy is so less so Guys these were a couple of Guys these were a couple of Guys these were a couple of classification algorithms that I showed classification algorithms that I showed classification algorithms that I showed you here now because our KNN classifier you here now because our KNN classifier you here now because our KNN classifier classified our data set more accurately classified our data set more accurately classified our data set more accurately we'll look at the predictions that the we'll look at the predictions that the we'll look at the predictions that the KNN classifier made okay now we're KNN classifier made okay now we're KNN classifier made okay now we're storing all our predicted values in the storing all our predicted values in the storing all our predicted values in the predict variable now in order to show predict variable now in order to show predict variable now in order to show you the accuracy of the Cann model we're you the accuracy of the Cann model we're you the accuracy of the Cann model we're going to use something known as the going to use something known as the going to use something known as the confusion Matrix so a confusion Matrix confusion Matrix so a confusion Matrix confusion Matrix so a confusion Matrix is a table that is often used to is a table that is often used to is a table that is often used to describe the performance of a describe the performance of a describe the performance of a classification model so confusion Matrix classification model so confusion Matrix classification model so confusion Matrix actually represents a tabular actually represents a tabular actually represents a tabular representation of actual versus representation of actual versus representation of actual versus predicted values so when you draw a predicted values so when you draw a predicted values so when you draw a confusion Matrix on the actual versus confusion Matrix on the actual versus confusion Matrix on the actual versus predicted values for the Cann classifier predicted values for the Cann classifier predicted values for the Cann classifier this is what the confusion Matrix looks this is what the confusion Matrix looks this is what the confusion Matrix looks like now we have four rows over here if like now we have four rows over here if like now we have four rows over here if you see we have four rows the first row you see we have four rows the first row you see we have four rows the first row represents apples second Mandarin third represents apples second Mandarin third represents apples second Mandarin third represents uh lemons and fourth oranges represents uh lemons and fourth oranges represents uh lemons and fourth oranges right so this four value corresponds to right so this four value corresponds to right so this four value corresponds to 0 comma 0 meaning that it was correctly 0 comma 0 meaning that it was correctly 0 comma 0 meaning that it was correctly able to classify all the four apples able to classify all the four apples able to classify all the four apples okay this one value represents one comma okay this one value represents one comma okay this one value represents one comma 1 meaning that a classifier correctly 1 meaning that a classifier correctly 1 meaning that a classifier correctly classified this as mandrin this made classified this as mandrin this made classified this as mandrin this made Matrix is drawn on actual values versus Matrix is drawn on actual values versus Matrix is drawn on actual values versus predicted values now if you look at the predicted values now if you look at the predicted values now if you look at the summary of the confusion Matrix you'll summary of the confusion Matrix you'll summary of the confusion Matrix you'll get something known as Precision recall get something known as Precision recall get something known as Precision recall F1 score and support Precision is F1 score and support Precision is F1 score and support Precision is basically the ratio of the correctly basically the ratio of the correctly basically the ratio of the correctly predicted positive observations to the predicted positive observations to the predicted positive observations to the total predicted positive observations so total predicted positive observations so total predicted positive observations so the correctly predicted positive the correctly predicted positive the correctly predicted positive observations are four and there are observations are four and there are observations are four and there are total of four apples in the testing data total of four apples in the testing data total of four apples in the testing data set so that's why get a Precision of one set so that's why get a Precision of one set so that's why get a Precision of one okay so recall on the other hand is a okay so recall on the other hand is a okay so recall on the other hand is a ratio of correctly predicted positive ratio of correctly predicted positive ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to all the observations in observations to all the observations in observations to all the observations in the class again we've correctly the class again we've correctly the class again we've correctly classified four apples and there are classified four apples and there are classified four apples and there are total of four apples F1 score is nothing total of four apples F1 score is nothing total of four apples F1 score is nothing but the weighted average of your but the weighted average of your but the weighted average of your presision and your recall okay and your presision and your recall okay and your presision and your recall okay and your support basically denotes the number of support basically denotes the number of support basically denotes the number of data points that were correctly data points that were correctly data points that were correctly classified so in our KNN algorithm since classified so in our KNN algorithm since classified so in our KNN algorithm since we got 100% accuracy all our data points we got 100% accuracy all our data points we got 100% accuracy all our data points were correctly classified so 15 out of were correctly classified so 15 out of were correctly classified so 15 out of 15 were correctly classified because we 15 were correctly classified because we 15 were correctly classified because we have a 100% accuracy so that's how you have a 100% accuracy so that's how you have a 100% accuracy so that's how you read a confusion Matrix okay you have read a confusion Matrix okay you have read a confusion Matrix okay you have four important measures Precision recall four important measures Precision recall four important measures Precision recall F1 score and support right F1 score is F1 score and support right F1 score is F1 score and support right F1 score is just the ratio or the weighted average just the ratio or the weighted average just the ratio or the weighted average of your precision and your recall so of your precision and your recall so of your precision and your recall so Precision is basically the correctly Precision is basically the correctly Precision is basically the correctly predicted positive observations to the predicted positive observations to the predicted positive observations to the total predicted positive observations total predicted positive observations total predicted positive observations theall is the ratio of the pred theall is the ratio of the pred theall is the ratio of the pred predicted positive observations to all predicted positive observations to all predicted positive observations to all your observations right so guys that was your observations right so guys that was your observations right so guys that was it for the demo of classification it for the demo of classification it for the demo of classification algorithms we discuss regression algorithms we discuss regression algorithms we discuss regression algorithms and we discuss classification algorithms and we discuss classification algorithms and we discuss classification algorithms now it's time to talk about algorithms now it's time to talk about algorithms now it's time to talk about unsupervised learning algorithms under unsupervised learning algorithms under unsupervised learning algorithms under unsupervised learning algorithms we try unsupervised learning algorithms we try unsupervised learning algorithms we try to solve clustering problems and the to solve clustering problems and the to solve clustering problems and the most important clustering algorithm that most important clustering algorithm that most important clustering algorithm that is known as K means clustering so we're is known as K means clustering so we're is known as K means clustering so we're going to discuss the K means algorithm going to discuss the K means algorithm going to discuss the K means algorithm I'll also show you a demo where we'll be I'll also show you a demo where we'll be I'll also show you a demo where we'll be executing the clustering algorithm and executing the clustering algorithm and executing the clustering algorithm and you know seeing how it is implemented to you know seeing how it is implemented to you know seeing how it is implemented to solve a problem now the main aim of the solve a problem now the main aim of the solve a problem now the main aim of the kin's algorithm is to group similar kin's algorithm is to group similar kin's algorithm is to group similar elements or data points into a cluster elements or data points into a cluster elements or data points into a cluster so it is basically the process by which so it is basically the process by which so it is basically the process by which objects are classified into a predefined objects are classified into a predefined objects are classified into a predefined number of groups so that they are much number of groups so that they are much number of groups so that they are much dissimilar as possible from one group to dissimilar as possible from one group to dissimilar as possible from one group to another group but as much similar as another group but as much similar as another group but as much similar as possible within each group now what I possible within each group now what I possible within each group now what I mean is let's say you're trying to mean is let's say you're trying to mean is let's say you're trying to cluster this population into four cluster this population into four cluster this population into four different groups such that each group different groups such that each group different groups such that each group has people within a specified range of has people within a specified range of has people within a specified range of age let's say group one is of people age let's say group one is of people age let's say group one is of people between the age 18 and 22 similarly between the age 18 and 22 similarly between the age 18 and 22 similarly group two is between 23 and 35 group group two is between 23 and 35 group group two is between 23 and 35 group three is 36 and 39 or something like three is 36 and 39 or something like three is 36 and 39 or something like that so let's say you're trying to that so let's say you're trying to that so let's say you're trying to Cluster people into different groups Cluster people into different groups Cluster people into different groups based on their age so for such problems based on their age so for such problems based on their age so for such problems you can make use of the keans clustering you can make use of the keans clustering you can make use of the keans clustering algorithm one of the major applications algorithm one of the major applications algorithm one of the major applications of the clustering algorithm is seen in of the clustering algorithm is seen in of the clustering algorithm is seen in targeted marketing I don't know how many targeted marketing I don't know how many targeted marketing I don't know how many of you are aware of targeted marketing of you are aware of targeted marketing of you are aware of targeted marketing targeted marketing is all about targeted marketing is all about targeted marketing is all about marketing a specific product to a marketing a specific product to a marketing a specific product to a specific audience let's say you're specific audience let's say you're specific audience let's say you're trying to sell fancy clothes or a fancy trying to sell fancy clothes or a fancy trying to sell fancy clothes or a fancy set of bags and all of that now the set of bags and all of that now the set of bags and all of that now the perfect audience for such product would perfect audience for such product would perfect audience for such product would be teenagers it would be people around be teenagers it would be people around be teenagers it would be people around the age of 16 to 21 or 18 so that is the age of 16 to 21 or 18 so that is the age of 16 to 21 or 18 so that is what targeted marketing is all about what targeted marketing is all about what targeted marketing is all about your product is marketed to a specific your product is marketed to a specific your product is marketed to a specific audience that might be interested in it audience that might be interested in it audience that might be interested in it that is what targeted marketing is so K that is what targeted marketing is so K that is what targeted marketing is so K means clustering is used majorly in means clustering is used majorly in means clustering is used majorly in targeted marketing a lot of e-commerce targeted marketing a lot of e-commerce targeted marketing a lot of e-commerce websites like Amazon flip card eBay all websites like Amazon flip card eBay all websites like Amazon flip card eBay all of these make use of clustering of these make use of clustering of these make use of clustering algorithms in order to Target the Right algorithms in order to Target the Right algorithms in order to Target the Right audience now let's see how the K means audience now let's see how the K means audience now let's see how the K means clustering works now the K in K means clustering works now the K in K means clustering works now the K in K means denotes the number of clusters let's say denotes the number of clusters let's say denotes the number of clusters let's say I give you a data set containing 20 I give you a data set containing 20 I give you a data set containing 20 points and you want to Cluster this data points and you want to Cluster this data points and you want to Cluster this data set into four clusters that means your K set into four clusters that means your K set into four clusters that means your K will be equal to four so K basically will be equal to four so K basically will be equal to four so K basically stands for the number of clusters in stands for the number of clusters in stands for the number of clusters in your data set or the number of clusters your data set or the number of clusters your data set or the number of clusters you want to form you start by defining you want to form you start by defining you want to form you start by defining the number K now for each of these the number K now for each of these the number K now for each of these clusters you're going to choose a clusters you're going to choose a clusters you're going to choose a centroid so for every cluster there are centroid so for every cluster there are centroid so for every cluster there are four clusters in our data set for each four clusters in our data set for each four clusters in our data set for each of these clusters you'll randomly select of these clusters you'll randomly select of these clusters you'll randomly select one of the data points as a centroid now one of the data points as a centroid now one of the data points as a centroid now what you'll do is you'll start Computing what you'll do is you'll start Computing what you'll do is you'll start Computing the distance from that centroid to every the distance from that centroid to every the distance from that centroid to every other point in that cluster as you keep other point in that cluster as you keep other point in that cluster as you keep Computing the centroid and the distance Computing the centroid and the distance Computing the centroid and the distance between the centroid and other data between the centroid and other data between the centroid and other data points in that cluster your centroid points in that cluster your centroid points in that cluster your centroid keeps shifting because you're trying to keeps shifting because you're trying to keeps shifting because you're trying to get to the average of that cluster get to the average of that cluster get to the average of that cluster whenever you're trying to get to the whenever you're trying to get to the whenever you're trying to get to the average of the cluster the centroid average of the cluster the centroid average of the cluster the centroid keeps shifting because the centroid keeps shifting because the centroid keeps shifting because the centroid keeps converging and it keeps shifting keeps converging and it keeps shifting keeps converging and it keeps shifting let's try to understand how key means let's try to understand how key means let's try to understand how key means Works let's say that this a data set Works let's say that this a data set Works let's say that this a data set like this is given to us let's say be like this is given to us let's say be like this is given to us let's say be given random points like these and you given random points like these and you given random points like these and you are asked to use key means algorithm on are asked to use key means algorithm on are asked to use key means algorithm on this so your first step will be to this so your first step will be to this so your first step will be to decide the number of clusters you want decide the number of clusters you want decide the number of clusters you want to create so let's say I want to create to create so let's say I want to create to create so let's say I want to create three different clusters so my K value three different clusters so my K value three different clusters so my K value will be equal to three The Next Step will be equal to three The Next Step will be equal to three The Next Step will be to provide centroids of all the will be to provide centroids of all the will be to provide centroids of all the Clusters what you'll do is initially Clusters what you'll do is initially Clusters what you'll do is initially you'll randomly pick three data points you'll randomly pick three data points you'll randomly pick three data points as your centroids for your three as your centroids for your three as your centroids for your three different clusters so basically this red different clusters so basically this red different clusters so basically this red denotes the centroid for one cluster denotes the centroid for one cluster denotes the centroid for one cluster blue denotes a centroid for another blue denotes a centroid for another blue denotes a centroid for another cluster and this Green Dot denotes the cluster and this Green Dot denotes the cluster and this Green Dot denotes the centroid for another cluster now what centroid for another cluster now what centroid for another cluster now what happens is in K means the algorithm will happens is in K means the algorithm will happens is in K means the algorithm will calculate the ukian distance of the calculate the ukian distance of the calculate the ukian distance of the points from each centroid and assign the points from each centroid and assign the points from each centroid and assign the points to the closest cluster now since points to the closest cluster now since points to the closest cluster now since we had three centroids here now what we had three centroids here now what we had three centroids here now what you're going to do is you're going to you're going to do is you're going to you're going to do is you're going to calculate the distance from each and calculate the distance from each and calculate the distance from each and every data point to all the centroids every data point to all the centroids every data point to all the centroids and you're going to check which data and you're going to check which data and you're going to check which data point is closest to which centroid so point is closest to which centroid so point is closest to which centroid so let's say data point a is closest to the let's say data point a is closest to the let's say data point a is closest to the blue centroid so you're going to assign blue centroid so you're going to assign blue centroid so you're going to assign the data point a to the blue cluster So the data point a to the blue cluster So the data point a to the blue cluster So based on the distance between the based on the distance between the based on the distance between the centroid and the cluster you're going to centroid and the cluster you're going to centroid and the cluster you're going to form three different clusters now again form three different clusters now again form three different clusters now again you're going to calculate the centroid you're going to calculate the centroid you're going to calculate the centroid and you're going to form a new cluster and you're going to form a new cluster and you're going to form a new cluster which is formed better clusters because which is formed better clusters because which is formed better clusters because you're recomputing all the centroids you're recomputing all the centroids you're recomputing all the centroids basically your centroids represent the basically your centroids represent the basically your centroids represent the mean of each of your cluster so you need mean of each of your cluster so you need mean of each of your cluster so you need to make sure that your mean is actually to make sure that your mean is actually to make sure that your mean is actually the centroid of each cluster the centroid of each cluster the centroid of each cluster so you'll keep recomputing these so you'll keep recomputing these so you'll keep recomputing these centroids until the position of your centroids until the position of your centroids until the position of your centroid does not change that means that centroid does not change that means that centroid does not change that means that your centroid is actually the mean or your centroid is actually the mean or your centroid is actually the mean or the average of that particular cluster the average of that particular cluster the average of that particular cluster so that's how K means works it's very so that's how K means works it's very so that's how K means works it's very simple all you have to do is you have to simple all you have to do is you have to simple all you have to do is you have to start by defining the K value after that start by defining the K value after that start by defining the K value after that you'll have to randomly pick the number you'll have to randomly pick the number you'll have to randomly pick the number of K centroids then you're going to of K centroids then you're going to of K centroids then you're going to calculate the average distance of each calculate the average distance of each calculate the average distance of each of the data points from the centroids of the data points from the centroids of the data points from the centroids and you're going to assign a data point and you're going to assign a data point and you're going to assign a data point to the centroid it is closing to that's to the centroid it is closing to that's to the centroid it is closing to that's how K means works it's a very simple how K means works it's a very simple how K means works it's a very simple process all you have to do is you have process all you have to do is you have process all you have to do is you have to keep iterating and you have to to keep iterating and you have to to keep iterating and you have to recompute the centroid value until the recompute the centroid value until the recompute the centroid value until the centroid value does not change until you centroid value does not change until you centroid value does not change until you get a constant centroid value now guys get a constant centroid value now guys get a constant centroid value now guys again in K means you make use of again in K means you make use of again in K means you make use of distance measures like ukan I already distance measures like ukan I already distance measures like ukan I already discussed what ukan is all about so to discussed what ukan is all about so to discussed what ukan is all about so to summarize how K means works you start by summarize how K means works you start by summarize how K means works you start by picking the number of clusters then you picking the number of clusters then you picking the number of clusters then you pick a centroid after that you calculate pick a centroid after that you calculate pick a centroid after that you calculate the distance of the objects to the the distance of the objects to the the distance of the objects to the centroid then you group the data points centroid then you group the data points centroid then you group the data points into specific clusters based on that into specific clusters based on that into specific clusters based on that distance you have to keep Computing the distance you have to keep Computing the distance you have to keep Computing the centroid until each data point is centroid until each data point is centroid until each data point is assigned to the closest cluster so assigned to the closest cluster so assigned to the closest cluster so that's how key means works now let's that's how key means works now let's that's how key means works now let's look at the elbow method the elbow look at the elbow method the elbow look at the elbow method the elbow method is basically used in order to method is basically used in order to method is basically used in order to find out the most Optimum K value for a find out the most Optimum K value for a find out the most Optimum K value for a particular problem so the elbow method particular problem so the elbow method particular problem so the elbow method is quite simple actually you start off is quite simple actually you start off is quite simple actually you start off by Computing the sum of squared errors by Computing the sum of squared errors by Computing the sum of squared errors for sum values of K now sum of squared for sum values of K now sum of squared for sum values of K now sum of squared error is basically the sum of the error is basically the sum of the error is basically the sum of the squared distance between each member of squared distance between each member of squared distance between each member of the cluster and its centroid so you the cluster and its centroid so you the cluster and its centroid so you basically calculate the sum of squared basically calculate the sum of squared basically calculate the sum of squared errors for different values of K for errors for different values of K for errors for different values of K for example you can consider K value as 2 4 example you can consider K value as 2 4 example you can consider K value as 2 4 6 8 10 12 consider all these values 6 8 10 12 consider all these values 6 8 10 12 consider all these values compute the sum of squared errors for compute the sum of squared errors for compute the sum of squared errors for each of these values now if you plot each of these values now if you plot each of these values now if you plot your K value against your sum of squared your K value against your sum of squared your K value against your sum of squared errors you will see that the error errors you will see that the error errors you will see that the error decreases as K gets larger this is decreases as K gets larger this is decreases as K gets larger this is because the number of clusters increase because the number of clusters increase because the number of clusters increase if the number of clusters increase it if the number of clusters increase it if the number of clusters increase it means that the Distortion gets smaller means that the Distortion gets smaller means that the Distortion gets smaller the Distortion keeps decreasing as the the Distortion keeps decreasing as the the Distortion keeps decreasing as the number of clusters increase that's number of clusters increase that's number of clusters increase that's because the more clusters you have the because the more clusters you have the because the more clusters you have the closer each centroid will be with its closer each centroid will be with its closer each centroid will be with its data points so as you keep increasing data points so as you keep increasing data points so as you keep increasing the number of clusters your Distortion the number of clusters your Distortion the number of clusters your Distortion will also decrease so the idea of the will also decrease so the idea of the will also decrease so the idea of the elbow method is to choose the K at which elbow method is to choose the K at which elbow method is to choose the K at which the Distortion decreases abruptly so if the Distortion decreases abruptly so if the Distortion decreases abruptly so if you look at this graph at K = to 4 the you look at this graph at K = to 4 the you look at this graph at K = to 4 the Distortion is abruptly decreasing so Distortion is abruptly decreasing so Distortion is abruptly decreasing so this is how you find the value of K when this is how you find the value of K when this is how you find the value of K when your Distortion drops abruptly that's your Distortion drops abruptly that's your Distortion drops abruptly that's the most optimal ke value you should be the most optimal ke value you should be the most optimal ke value you should be choosing for your problem statement so choosing for your problem statement so choosing for your problem statement so let me repeat the idea behind the elbow let me repeat the idea behind the elbow let me repeat the idea behind the elbow method you're just going to graph the method you're just going to graph the method you're just going to graph the number of clusters you have versus the number of clusters you have versus the number of clusters you have versus the squared sum of errors this graph will squared sum of errors this graph will squared sum of errors this graph will basically give you the Distortion now basically give you the Distortion now basically give you the Distortion now the Distortion is obviously going to the Distortion is obviously going to the Distortion is obviously going to decrease if you increase the number of decrease if you increase the number of decrease if you increase the number of clusters and there is going to be one clusters and there is going to be one clusters and there is going to be one point in this graph wherein the point in this graph wherein the point in this graph wherein the Distortion decreases very abruptly now Distortion decreases very abruptly now Distortion decreases very abruptly now for that point you need to find out the for that point you need to find out the for that point you need to find out the value of K and that will be your most value of K and that will be your most value of K and that will be your most optimal K value that's how you choose optimal K value that's how you choose optimal K value that's how you choose your K means K value and your KN andn K your K means K value and your KN andn K your K means K value and your KN andn K value as well so guys this is how the value as well so guys this is how the value as well so guys this is how the elbow method is it's very simple and it elbow method is it's very simple and it elbow method is it's very simple and it can be easily implemented now we're can be easily implemented now we're can be easily implemented now we're going to look at a small demo which going to look at a small demo which going to look at a small demo which involves key means this is actually a involves key means this is actually a involves key means this is actually a very interesting demo now guys one very interesting demo now guys one very interesting demo now guys one interesting application of clustering is interesting application of clustering is interesting application of clustering is in color compression with images for in color compression with images for in color compression with images for example imagine you have an image with example imagine you have an image with example imagine you have an image with millions of colors in it in most images millions of colors in it in most images millions of colors in it in most images a large number of colors will be unused a large number of colors will be unused a large number of colors will be unused and many of the pixels in the image will and many of the pixels in the image will and many of the pixels in the image will have similar or even identical colors have similar or even identical colors have similar or even identical colors now having too many colors in your image now having too many colors in your image now having too many colors in your image makes it very hard for image processing makes it very hard for image processing makes it very hard for image processing and image analysis so this is one area and image analysis so this is one area and image analysis so this is one area where K's is applied very often it's where K's is applied very often it's where K's is applied very often it's applied in image segmentation image applied in image segmentation image applied in image segmentation image analysis image compression and so on so analysis image compression and so on so analysis image compression and so on so what we're going to do in this demo is what we're going to do in this demo is what we're going to do in this demo is we're going to use an image from the we're going to use an image from the we're going to use an image from the psych learn data set okay it is a psych learn data set okay it is a psych learn data set okay it is a pre-built image and you will require to pre-built image and you will require to pre-built image and you will require to install the pillow package for this install the pillow package for this install the pillow package for this we're going to use an image from the we're going to use an image from the we're going to use an image from the cycle learn data set module so we'll cycle learn data set module so we'll cycle learn data set module so we'll Begin by importing the libraries as Begin by importing the libraries as Begin by importing the libraries as usual and we'll be loading our image as usual and we'll be loading our image as usual and we'll be loading our image as China the image is china. jpeg and we'll China the image is china. jpeg and we'll China the image is china. jpeg and we'll be loading this in a variable called be loading this in a variable called be loading this in a variable called China so if you want to look at the China so if you want to look at the China so if you want to look at the shape of our image you can run this shape of our image you can run this shape of our image you can run this command so we're going to get a command so we're going to get a command so we're going to get a threedimensional value so we're getting threedimensional value so we're getting threedimensional value so we're getting 427a 640 comma 3 now this is basically a 427a 640 comma 3 now this is basically a 427a 640 comma 3 now this is basically a three-dimensional array of size height three-dimensional array of size height three-dimensional array of size height width and RGB it contains red blue green width and RGB it contains red blue green width and RGB it contains red blue green contributions as integers from 0 to 255 contributions as integers from 0 to 255 contributions as integers from 0 to 255 so your pixel values range between 0 and so your pixel values range between 0 and so your pixel values range between 0 and 255 and I think zero stands for your 255 and I think zero stands for your 255 and I think zero stands for your black and 255 represents white if I'm black and 255 represents white if I'm black and 255 represents white if I'm not wrong and basically that's what this not wrong and basically that's what this not wrong and basically that's what this area shape denotes now one way we can area shape denotes now one way we can area shape denotes now one way we can view this set of pixels is as a cloud of view this set of pixels is as a cloud of view this set of pixels is as a cloud of points in a three-dimensional color points in a three-dimensional color points in a three-dimensional color space so what we'll do is we will space so what we'll do is we will space so what we'll do is we will reshape the data and rescale the color reshape the data and rescale the color reshape the data and rescale the color so that they lie between zero and one so so that they lie between zero and one so so that they lie between zero and one so the output of this will be a the output of this will be a the output of this will be a two-dimensional Arena so basically we two-dimensional Arena so basically we two-dimensional Arena so basically we can visualize these pixels in this color can visualize these pixels in this color can visualize these pixels in this color space now what we're going to do is space now what we're going to do is space now what we're going to do is we're going to try and plot our pixels we're going to try and plot our pixels we're going to try and plot our pixels we have a really huge data set which we have a really huge data set which we have a really huge data set which contains around 16 million possible contains around 16 million possible contains around 16 million possible colors so this denotes a very very large colors so this denotes a very very large colors so this denotes a very very large data set so let me show you what it data set so let me show you what it data set so let me show you what it looks like we have red against green and looks like we have red against green and looks like we have red against green and red against Blue these are our RGB red against Blue these are our RGB red against Blue these are our RGB values and we can have around 16 million values and we can have around 16 million values and we can have around 16 million possible combination of colors the data possible combination of colors the data possible combination of colors the data set is way too large for us to compute set is way too large for us to compute set is way too large for us to compute so what we'll do is we will reduce the so what we'll do is we will reduce the so what we'll do is we will reduce the 16 million colors to just 16 colors we 16 million colors to just 16 colors we 16 million colors to just 16 colors we can do that by using K means clustering can do that by using K means clustering can do that by using K means clustering because we can cluster similar colors because we can cluster similar colors because we can cluster similar colors into similar groups so this is exactly into similar groups so this is exactly into similar groups so this is exactly where we'll be importing K means now one where we'll be importing K means now one where we'll be importing K means now one thing to note here is because we're thing to note here is because we're thing to note here is because we're dealing with a very large data set we dealing with a very large data set we dealing with a very large data set we will use the mini batch K means this will use the mini batch K means this will use the mini batch K means this operates on subsets of the data to operates on subsets of the data to operates on subsets of the data to compute the results more quickly and compute the results more quickly and compute the results more quickly and more accurately just like the K means more accurately just like the K means more accurately just like the K means algorithm because I told you this data algorithm because I told you this data algorithm because I told you this data set is really huge even though this is a set is really huge even though this is a set is really huge even though this is a single image the number of of pixel single image the number of of pixel single image the number of of pixel combinations can come up to 16 million combinations can come up to 16 million combinations can come up to 16 million which is a lot now each pixel is which is a lot now each pixel is which is a lot now each pixel is considered as a data point when you take considered as a data point when you take considered as a data point when you take an image into consideration when you an image into consideration when you an image into consideration when you have data points and data values that's have data points and data values that's have data points and data values that's different when you're studying an image different when you're studying an image different when you're studying an image for image classification or image for image classification or image for image classification or image segmentation each and every pixel is segmentation each and every pixel is segmentation each and every pixel is considered so basically you're building considered so basically you're building considered so basically you're building matrices of all of these pixel values so matrices of all of these pixel values so matrices of all of these pixel values so having 16 million pixels is a very huge having 16 million pixels is a very huge having 16 million pixels is a very huge data set so for that reason we'll be data set so for that reason we'll be data set so for that reason we'll be using the mini badge K means it's very using the mini badge K means it's very using the mini badge K means it's very similar to K means only difference is similar to K means only difference is similar to K means only difference is that it'll operate on subsets of the that it'll operate on subsets of the that it'll operate on subsets of the data because the data set is too huge data because the data set is too huge data because the data set is too huge it'll operate on subsets so basically it'll operate on subsets so basically it'll operate on subsets so basically we're making use of K means in order to we're making use of K means in order to we're making use of K means in order to Cluster these 16 million color Cluster these 16 million color Cluster these 16 million color combinations into just 16 colors so combinations into just 16 colors so combinations into just 16 colors so basically we're going to form 16 basically we're going to form 16 basically we're going to form 16 clusters in this data set now the result clusters in this data set now the result clusters in this data set now the result is a recoloring of the original pixel is a recoloring of the original pixel is a recoloring of the original pixel where every pixel is assigned the color where every pixel is assigned the color where every pixel is assigned the color of its closest cluster Center let's say of its closest cluster Center let's say of its closest cluster Center let's say that there are a couple of colors which that there are a couple of colors which that there are a couple of colors which are very close to Green so we're going are very close to Green so we're going are very close to Green so we're going to Cluster all of these similar colors to Cluster all of these similar colors to Cluster all of these similar colors into one cluster we'll keep doing this into one cluster we'll keep doing this into one cluster we'll keep doing this until we get 16 clusters so obviously to until we get 16 clusters so obviously to until we get 16 clusters so obviously to do this we'll be using the clustering do this we'll be using the clustering do this we'll be using the clustering method camans let me show you what the method camans let me show you what the method camans let me show you what the output looks like so basically this was output looks like so basically this was output looks like so basically this was the original image from the psychic data the original image from the psychic data the original image from the psychic data set and this is the 16 color segmented set and this is the 16 color segmented set and this is the 16 color segmented image basically we have only 16 colors image basically we have only 16 colors image basically we have only 16 colors here here we can have around 16 million here here we can have around 16 million here here we can have around 16 million color colors here there are only 16 color colors here there are only 16 color colors here there are only 16 colors if you count also you can only colors if you count also you can only colors if you count also you can only see particular colors now obviously see particular colors now obviously see particular colors now obviously there's a lot of distortion over here there's a lot of distortion over here there's a lot of distortion over here but this is how you study an image but this is how you study an image but this is how you study an image remove all the extra contrast that is remove all the extra contrast that is remove all the extra contrast that is there in an image you try to reduce the there in an image you try to reduce the there in an image you try to reduce the pixels to a smaller set of data as pixels to a smaller set of data as pixels to a smaller set of data as possible the more varied pixels you have possible the more varied pixels you have possible the more varied pixels you have the harder it is going to be for you to the harder it is going to be for you to the harder it is going to be for you to study the image for analysis now study the image for analysis now study the image for analysis now obviously there are some details which obviously there are some details which obviously there are some details which are lost in this but overall the image are lost in this but overall the image are lost in this but overall the image is still recognizable so here basically is still recognizable so here basically is still recognizable so here basically Al we've compressed this with a Al we've compressed this with a Al we've compressed this with a compression factor of around 1 million compression factor of around 1 million compression factor of around 1 million because each cluster will have around 1 because each cluster will have around 1 because each cluster will have around 1 million data points in it or pixel million data points in it or pixel million data points in it or pixel values in it or pixels in it now this is values in it or pixels in it now this is values in it or pixels in it now this is an interesting application of ke means an interesting application of ke means an interesting application of ke means there are actually better ways you can there are actually better ways you can there are actually better ways you can compress information and image so compress information and image so compress information and image so basically I showed you this example basically I showed you this example basically I showed you this example because I want you to understand the because I want you to understand the because I want you to understand the power of K means algorithm you can power of K means algorithm you can power of K means algorithm you can cluster a data set that is this huge cluster a data set that is this huge cluster a data set that is this huge into just 16 colors initially there were into just 16 colors initially there were into just 16 colors initially there were 16 million and now you can cluster it to 16 million and now you can cluster it to 16 million and now you can cluster it to 16 colors so guys kin plays a very huge 16 colors so guys kin plays a very huge 16 colors so guys kin plays a very huge role in computer vision image processing role in computer vision image processing role in computer vision image processing object detection and so on it's a very object detection and so on it's a very object detection and so on it's a very important algorithm when it comes to important algorithm when it comes to important algorithm when it comes to detecting objects so in self-driving detecting objects so in self-driving detecting objects so in self-driving cars and all you can make use of such cars and all you can make use of such cars and all you can make use of such algorithms so guys that was all about algorithms so guys that was all about algorithms so guys that was all about unsupervised learning and supervised unsupervised learning and supervised unsupervised learning and supervised learning now it's the last type of learning now it's the last type of learning now it's the last type of machine learning which is reinforcement machine learning which is reinforcement machine learning which is reinforcement learning now this is actually a very learning now this is actually a very learning now this is actually a very interesting part of machine learning and interesting part of machine learning and interesting part of machine learning and it is quite different from supervised it is quite different from supervised it is quite different from supervised and unsupervised so we'll be discussing and unsupervised so we'll be discussing and unsupervised so we'll be discussing all the concepts that are involved in all the concepts that are involved in all the concepts that are involved in reinforcement learning and also reinforcement learning and also reinforcement learning and also reinforcement learning is a little more reinforcement learning is a little more reinforcement learning is a little more advanced when I say advance I mean that advanced when I say advance I mean that advanced when I say advance I mean that it's been used in applications such as it's been used in applications such as it's been used in applications such as self-driving cars and is also a part of self-driving cars and is also a part of self-driving cars and is also a part of a lot of deep learning applications such a lot of deep learning applications such a lot of deep learning applications such as alphao and so on so reinforcement as alphao and so on so reinforcement as alphao and so on so reinforcement learning has a different concept to it learning has a different concept to it learning has a different concept to it itself so we'll be discussing all the itself so we'll be discussing all the itself so we'll be discussing all the concepts under it so just to brush up concepts under it so just to brush up concepts under it so just to brush up your information about reinforcement your information about reinforcement your information about reinforcement learning reinforcement learning is a learning reinforcement learning is a learning reinforcement learning is a part of machine learning where an agent part of machine learning where an agent part of machine learning where an agent is put in an unknown environment and he is put in an unknown environment and he is put in an unknown environment and he learns how to behave in this environment learns how to behave in this environment learns how to behave in this environment by performing certain actions and by performing certain actions and by performing certain actions and observing the rewards which it gets from observing the rewards which it gets from observing the rewards which it gets from these actions reinforcement learning is these actions reinforcement learning is these actions reinforcement learning is all about taking an appropriate action all about taking an appropriate action all about taking an appropriate action in order to maximize the reward in a in order to maximize the reward in a in order to maximize the reward in a particular situation now let's particular situation now let's particular situation now let's understand reinforcement learning with understand reinforcement learning with understand reinforcement learning with an analogy let's consider a scenario an analogy let's consider a scenario an analogy let's consider a scenario wherein a baby is learning how to work wherein a baby is learning how to work wherein a baby is learning how to work this scenario can go about in two this scenario can go about in two this scenario can go about in two different ways the first is baby starts different ways the first is baby starts different ways the first is baby starts walking and it makes it to the candy and walking and it makes it to the candy and walking and it makes it to the candy and since the candy is the end goal the baby since the candy is the end goal the baby since the candy is the end goal the baby is very happy and it's positive meaning is very happy and it's positive meaning is very happy and it's positive meaning the baby is happy and it received a the baby is happy and it received a the baby is happy and it received a positive reward now the second way this positive reward now the second way this positive reward now the second way this can go on is that the baby starts can go on is that the baby starts can go on is that the baby starts walking but it falls due to some hurdle walking but it falls due to some hurdle walking but it falls due to some hurdle in between that's really cute so the in between that's really cute so the in between that's really cute so the baby gets hurt and it doesn't get to the baby gets hurt and it doesn't get to the baby gets hurt and it doesn't get to the candy it's negative because the baby is candy it's negative because the baby is candy it's negative because the baby is sad and it receives a negative negative sad and it receives a negative negative sad and it receives a negative negative reward so just like how we humans learn reward so just like how we humans learn reward so just like how we humans learn from our mistakes by trial and error from our mistakes by trial and error from our mistakes by trial and error reinforcement learning is also similar reinforcement learning is also similar reinforcement learning is also similar here we have an agent and in this case here we have an agent and in this case here we have an agent and in this case the agent is the baby and the reward is the agent is the baby and the reward is the agent is the baby and the reward is the candy with many hurdles in between the candy with many hurdles in between the candy with many hurdles in between the agent is supposed to find the best the agent is supposed to find the best the agent is supposed to find the best possible path to reach the reward that possible path to reach the reward that possible path to reach the reward that is the main goal of reinforcement is the main goal of reinforcement is the main goal of reinforcement learning now the reinforcement learning learning now the reinforcement learning learning now the reinforcement learning process has two important components it process has two important components it process has two important components it has something known as an agent and has something known as an agent and has something known as an agent and something known as an environment now something known as an environment now something known as an environment now the environment is the setting that the the environment is the setting that the the environment is the setting that the agent is acting on and the agent agent is acting on and the agent agent is acting on and the agent represents the reinforcement learning represents the reinforcement learning represents the reinforcement learning algorithm the whole reinforcement algorithm the whole reinforcement algorithm the whole reinforcement learning algorithm is basically the learning algorithm is basically the learning algorithm is basically the agent the environment is the setting in agent the environment is the setting in agent the environment is the setting in which you place the agent and it is a which you place the agent and it is a which you place the agent and it is a setting wherein the agent takes various setting wherein the agent takes various setting wherein the agent takes various actions the reinforcement learning actions the reinforcement learning actions the reinforcement learning process starts when the environment process starts when the environment process starts when the environment sends a state to the agent now the agent sends a state to the agent now the agent sends a state to the agent now the agent based on the observations it makes he based on the observations it makes he based on the observations it makes he takes an action in responds to that takes an action in responds to that takes an action in responds to that state now in turn the environment will state now in turn the environment will state now in turn the environment will send the next state and the respective send the next state and the respective send the next state and the respective reward back to the agent now the agent reward back to the agent now the agent reward back to the agent now the agent will update its knowledge with the will update its knowledge with the will update its knowledge with the reward returned by the environment to reward returned by the environment to reward returned by the environment to evaluate its last actions the loop evaluate its last actions the loop evaluate its last actions the loop continues until the environment sends a continues until the environment sends a continues until the environment sends a terminal state which means that the terminal state which means that the terminal state which means that the agent has accomplished all of his tasks agent has accomplished all of his tasks agent has accomplished all of his tasks to understand this better let's suppose to understand this better let's suppose to understand this better let's suppose that our agent is playing Counter Strike that our agent is playing Counter Strike that our agent is playing Counter Strike so the reinforcement learning process so the reinforcement learning process so the reinforcement learning process can be broken down into a couple of can be broken down into a couple of can be broken down into a couple of steps the first step is the steps the first step is the steps the first step is the reinforcement learning agent which is reinforcement learning agent which is reinforcement learning agent which is basically the player he collects a state basically the player he collects a state basically the player he collects a state s not from the environment so whenever s not from the environment so whenever s not from the environment so whenever you're playing counter- strike you start you're playing counter- strike you start you're playing counter- strike you start off with Stage zero or stage one you off with Stage zero or stage one you off with Stage zero or stage one you start off from the first level now based start off from the first level now based start off from the first level now based on this state s notot the reinforcement on this state s notot the reinforcement on this state s notot the reinforcement learning agent will take an action a not learning agent will take an action a not learning agent will take an action a not so guys action can be anything that so guys action can be anything that so guys action can be anything that causes a result now if the agent moves causes a result now if the agent moves causes a result now if the agent moves left or right in the game that is also left or right in the game that is also left or right in the game that is also considered as an action so initially the considered as an action so initially the considered as an action so initially the action will be random because uh the action will be random because uh the action will be random because uh the agent has no clue about the environment agent has no clue about the environment agent has no clue about the environment let's suppose that you're playing let's suppose that you're playing let's suppose that you're playing Counter Strike for the first time you Counter Strike for the first time you Counter Strike for the first time you have no idea about how to play it so have no idea about how to play it so have no idea about how to play it so you'll just start randomly you'll just you'll just start randomly you'll just you'll just start randomly you'll just go with whatever whichever action you go with whatever whichever action you go with whatever whichever action you think is right now the environment is think is right now the environment is think is right now the environment is now in a state one after passing state now in a state one after passing state now in a state one after passing state zero the environment will go into State zero the environment will go into State zero the environment will go into State one once the environment updates the one once the environment updates the one once the environment updates the state to state one the reinforcement state to state one the reinforcement state to state one the reinforcement learning agent will get a reward R1 from learning agent will get a reward R1 from learning agent will get a reward R1 from the environment this reward can be the environment this reward can be the environment this reward can be anything like additional points or anything like additional points or anything like additional points or you'll get additional weapons when you'll get additional weapons when you'll get additional weapons when you're playing a Counter Strike now this you're playing a Counter Strike now this you're playing a Counter Strike now this reinforcement learning Loop will go on reinforcement learning Loop will go on reinforcement learning Loop will go on until the agent is dead or reaches the until the agent is dead or reaches the until the agent is dead or reaches the destination and it continuously outputs destination and it continuously outputs destination and it continuously outputs a sequence of State action and rewards a sequence of State action and rewards a sequence of State action and rewards this is exactly how reinforcement this is exactly how reinforcement this is exactly how reinforcement learning works it starts with the agent learning works it starts with the agent learning works it starts with the agent being put in an environment and the being put in an environment and the being put in an environment and the agent will randomly take some action in agent will randomly take some action in agent will randomly take some action in that state zero after taking an action that state zero after taking an action that state zero after taking an action depending on his action he'll either get depending on his action he'll either get depending on his action he'll either get a reward and move on to state number one a reward and move on to state number one a reward and move on to state number one or he will either die and go back to the or he will either die and go back to the or he will either die and go back to the same state so this will keep happening same state so this will keep happening same state so this will keep happening until the agent reaches the last stage until the agent reaches the last stage until the agent reaches the last stage or he you know dies or reaches his or he you know dies or reaches his or he you know dies or reaches his destination that's exactly how destination that's exactly how destination that's exactly how reinforcement learning works now reinforcement learning works now reinforcement learning works now reinforcement learning is the logic reinforcement learning is the logic reinforcement learning is the logic behind a lot of games these days it's behind a lot of games these days it's behind a lot of games these days it's been implemented in various games such been implemented in various games such been implemented in various games such as DOTA a lot of you who play DotA might as DOTA a lot of you who play DotA might as DOTA a lot of you who play DotA might know this now let's talk about a couple know this now let's talk about a couple know this now let's talk about a couple of reinforcement learning definitions or of reinforcement learning definitions or of reinforcement learning definitions or terminologies so first we have something terminologies so first we have something terminologies so first we have something known as is the agent like I mentioned known as is the agent like I mentioned known as is the agent like I mentioned an agent is the reinforcement learning an agent is the reinforcement learning an agent is the reinforcement learning algorithm that learns from trial and algorithm that learns from trial and algorithm that learns from trial and error an agent is the one that takes error an agent is the one that takes error an agent is the one that takes actions like for example a soldier in actions like for example a soldier in actions like for example a soldier in counter- strike navigating through the counter- strike navigating through the counter- strike navigating through the game going right left and all of that is game going right left and all of that is game going right left and all of that is the agent taking some action the the agent taking some action the the agent taking some action the environment is basically the world environment is basically the world environment is basically the world through which the agent moves now the through which the agent moves now the through which the agent moves now the environment basically takes the agent's environment basically takes the agent's environment basically takes the agent's current state and action as input and current state and action as input and current state and action as input and Returns the agent reward and its next Returns the agent reward and its next Returns the agent reward and its next State as the output next we have State as the output next we have State as the output next we have something known as action all the something known as action all the something known as action all the possible steps that an agent can take is possible steps that an agent can take is possible steps that an agent can take is considered as an action next we have considered as an action next we have considered as an action next we have something known as state now the current something known as state now the current something known as state now the current condition returned by the environment is condition returned by the environment is condition returned by the environment is known as the state reward is an instant known as the state reward is an instant known as the state reward is an instant return from the environment to appraise return from the environment to appraise return from the environment to appraise The Last Action of the reinforcement The Last Action of the reinforcement The Last Action of the reinforcement learning agent all of these terms are learning agent all of these terms are learning agent all of these terms are pretty understandable next we have pretty understandable next we have pretty understandable next we have something known as policy now policy is something known as policy now policy is something known as policy now policy is the approach that the agent uses to the approach that the agent uses to the approach that the agent uses to determine the next next action based on determine the next next action based on determine the next next action based on the current state policy is basically the current state policy is basically the current state policy is basically the approach with which you go around in the approach with which you go around in the approach with which you go around in the environment next we have something the environment next we have something the environment next we have something known as value now the expected known as value now the expected known as value now the expected long-term return with discount as long-term return with discount as long-term return with discount as opposed to the short-term reward R is opposed to the short-term reward R is opposed to the short-term reward R is known as value now terms like discount known as value now terms like discount known as value now terms like discount and value I'll be discussing in the and value I'll be discussing in the and value I'll be discussing in the upcoming slides now action value is also upcoming slides now action value is also upcoming slides now action value is also very similar to the value except it very similar to the value except it very similar to the value except it takes an extra parameter known as the takes an extra parameter known as the takes an extra parameter known as the current action don't worry about action current action don't worry about action current action don't worry about action and Q value we'll talk about all of this and Q value we'll talk about all of this and Q value we'll talk about all of this in the upcoming slides so make yourself in the upcoming slides so make yourself in the upcoming slides so make yourself familiar with these terms because you'll familiar with these terms because you'll familiar with these terms because you'll be seeing a whole lot of them in this be seeing a whole lot of them in this be seeing a whole lot of them in this session so before we move any further session so before we move any further session so before we move any further let's discuss a couple of more let's discuss a couple of more let's discuss a couple of more reinforcement learning Concepts now we reinforcement learning Concepts now we reinforcement learning Concepts now we have something known as reward have something known as reward have something known as reward maximization so if you haven't realized maximization so if you haven't realized maximization so if you haven't realized it already the basic aim of it already the basic aim of it already the basic aim of reinforcement learning agent is to reinforcement learning agent is to reinforcement learning agent is to maximize the reward how does this happen maximize the reward how does this happen maximize the reward how does this happen let's try to understand this in a little let's try to understand this in a little let's try to understand this in a little more detail so basically the agent works more detail so basically the agent works more detail so basically the agent works based on the theory of reward based on the theory of reward based on the theory of reward maximization now this is exactly why the maximization now this is exactly why the maximization now this is exactly why the agent must be trained in such a way that agent must be trained in such a way that agent must be trained in such a way that he takes the best action so that the he takes the best action so that the he takes the best action so that the reward is maximum now let me explain a reward is maximum now let me explain a reward is maximum now let me explain a reward maximization with a small example reward maximization with a small example reward maximization with a small example now in this figure you can see there is now in this figure you can see there is now in this figure you can see there is a fox there is some meat and there is a a fox there is some meat and there is a a fox there is some meat and there is a tiger our reinforcement learning agent tiger our reinforcement learning agent tiger our reinforcement learning agent is the fox now his end goal is to eat is the fox now his end goal is to eat is the fox now his end goal is to eat the maximum amount of meat before being the maximum amount of meat before being the maximum amount of meat before being eaten by the tiger now because the fox eaten by the tiger now because the fox eaten by the tiger now because the fox is a very clever guy guy he eats the is a very clever guy guy he eats the is a very clever guy guy he eats the meat that is closer to him rather than meat that is closer to him rather than meat that is closer to him rather than the meat which is close to the tiger the meat which is close to the tiger the meat which is close to the tiger because the closer he gets to the tiger because the closer he gets to the tiger because the closer he gets to the tiger the higher are his chances of getting the higher are his chances of getting the higher are his chances of getting killed that's pretty obvious even if the killed that's pretty obvious even if the killed that's pretty obvious even if the reward near the tiger are bigger meat reward near the tiger are bigger meat reward near the tiger are bigger meat junks that'll be discounted this is junks that'll be discounted this is junks that'll be discounted this is exactly what discount is we just exactly what discount is we just exactly what discount is we just discussed it in the previous slide this discussed it in the previous slide this discussed it in the previous slide this is done because of the uncertainty is done because of the uncertainty is done because of the uncertainty factor that the tiger might actually factor that the tiger might actually factor that the tiger might actually kill the fox now the next thing to kill the fox now the next thing to kill the fox now the next thing to understand is how discounting of reward understand is how discounting of reward understand is how discounting of reward works now in order to understand works now in order to understand works now in order to understand discounting we Define a discount rate discounting we Define a discount rate discounting we Define a discount rate called gamma the value of gamma is called gamma the value of gamma is called gamma the value of gamma is between zero and one and the smaller the between zero and one and the smaller the between zero and one and the smaller the gamma the larger the discount and so on gamma the larger the discount and so on gamma the larger the discount and so on now don't worry about these Concepts now don't worry about these Concepts now don't worry about these Concepts gamma and all of that we'll be seeing gamma and all of that we'll be seeing gamma and all of that we'll be seeing that in our practical demo today so that in our practical demo today so that in our practical demo today so let's move on and discuss another let's move on and discuss another let's move on and discuss another concept known as exploration and concept known as exploration and concept known as exploration and exploitation trade-off now guys before exploitation trade-off now guys before exploitation trade-off now guys before that I hope all of you understood reward that I hope all of you understood reward that I hope all of you understood reward maximization basically the main aim maximization basically the main aim maximization basically the main aim behind reinforcement learning is to behind reinforcement learning is to behind reinforcement learning is to maximize the rewards that an agent can maximize the rewards that an agent can maximize the rewards that an agent can get now one of the most important get now one of the most important get now one of the most important Concepts in reinforcement learning is Concepts in reinforcement learning is Concepts in reinforcement learning is the exploration and exploitation the exploration and exploitation the exploration and exploitation trade-off now exploration like the name trade-off now exploration like the name trade-off now exploration like the name suggests it's about exploring and suggests it's about exploring and suggests it's about exploring and capturing more information about an capturing more information about an capturing more information about an environment on the other hand environment on the other hand environment on the other hand exploitation is about using the already exploitation is about using the already exploitation is about using the already known exploited information to heighten known exploited information to heighten known exploited information to heighten your reward now consider the same your reward now consider the same your reward now consider the same example that we saw previously so here example that we saw previously so here example that we saw previously so here the fox eats only the meat chunks which the fox eats only the meat chunks which the fox eats only the meat chunks which are close to him he doesn't eat the are close to him he doesn't eat the are close to him he doesn't eat the bigger meat chunks which are at the top bigger meat chunks which are at the top bigger meat chunks which are at the top even though the bigger meat chunks would even though the bigger meat chunks would even though the bigger meat chunks would get him more reward so if the fox only get him more reward so if the fox only get him more reward so if the fox only focuses on the closest reward he will focuses on the closest reward he will focuses on the closest reward he will never reach the big chunks of meat this never reach the big chunks of meat this never reach the big chunks of meat this process is known as exploitation but if process is known as exploitation but if process is known as exploitation but if the fox decides to explore a bit it can the fox decides to explore a bit it can the fox decides to explore a bit it can find the bigger reward which is the big find the bigger reward which is the big find the bigger reward which is the big chunk of meat this is known as chunk of meat this is known as chunk of meat this is known as exploration so this is the difference exploration so this is the difference exploration so this is the difference between exploitation and duration it's between exploitation and duration it's between exploitation and duration it's always best if the agent explores the always best if the agent explores the always best if the agent explores the environment tries to figure out a way in environment tries to figure out a way in environment tries to figure out a way in which he can get the maximum number of which he can get the maximum number of which he can get the maximum number of rewards now let's discuss another rewards now let's discuss another rewards now let's discuss another important Concept in reinforcement important Concept in reinforcement important Concept in reinforcement learning which is known as the markout learning which is known as the markout learning which is known as the markout decision process basically the decision process basically the decision process basically the mathematical approach for mapping a mathematical approach for mapping a mathematical approach for mapping a solution in reinforcement learning is solution in reinforcement learning is solution in reinforcement learning is called markout decision process it's the called markout decision process it's the called markout decision process it's the mathematics behind reinforcement mathematics behind reinforcement mathematics behind reinforcement learning now in a way the purpose of learning now in a way the purpose of learning now in a way the purpose of reinforcement learning is to solve a reinforcement learning is to solve a reinforcement learning is to solve a mark out decision process now in order mark out decision process now in order mark out decision process now in order to get a solution there are a set of to get a solution there are a set of to get a solution there are a set of parameters in a markout decision process parameters in a markout decision process parameters in a markout decision process there's a set of actions a there's a set there's a set of actions a there's a set there's a set of actions a there's a set of States s reward R policy pi and value of States s reward R policy pi and value of States s reward R policy pi and value V also this image represents how a V also this image represents how a V also this image represents how a reinforcement learning process works reinforcement learning process works reinforcement learning process works there's an agent the agent takes some there's an agent the agent takes some there's an agent the agent takes some action on the environment the action on the environment the action on the environment the environment in turn will reward the environment in turn will reward the environment in turn will reward the agent and it will give him the next date agent and it will give him the next date agent and it will give him the next date that's how reinforcement learning that's how reinforcement learning that's how reinforcement learning process works so to sum everything up process works so to sum everything up process works so to sum everything up what happens in Mark out decision what happens in Mark out decision what happens in Mark out decision process and reinforcement learning is process and reinforcement learning is process and reinforcement learning is the agent has to take an action a to the agent has to take an action a to the agent has to take an action a to transition from the start state to the transition from the start state to the transition from the start state to the end State s while doing so the agent end State s while doing so the agent end State s while doing so the agent will receive some reward R for each will receive some reward R for each will receive some reward R for each action he takes now the series of action he takes now the series of action he takes now the series of actions that are taken by the agent actions that are taken by the agent actions that are taken by the agent Define the policy and the rewards Define the policy and the rewards Define the policy and the rewards collected Define the value the main goal collected Define the value the main goal collected Define the value the main goal here is to maximize the rewards by here is to maximize the rewards by here is to maximize the rewards by choosing the optimum policy so you're choosing the optimum policy so you're choosing the optimum policy so you're going to choose the best possible going to choose the best possible going to choose the best possible approach in order to maximize the approach in order to maximize the approach in order to maximize the rewards that's the main aim of Mark out rewards that's the main aim of Mark out rewards that's the main aim of Mark out decision process to understand Mark out decision process to understand Mark out decision process to understand Mark out decision process let's look at a small decision process let's look at a small decision process let's look at a small example I'm sure all of you already know example I'm sure all of you already know example I'm sure all of you already know about the shortest path problem right we about the shortest path problem right we about the shortest path problem right we all had such problems and Concepts in all had such problems and Concepts in all had such problems and Concepts in math to find the shortest path now math to find the shortest path now math to find the shortest path now consider this representation over here consider this representation over here consider this representation over here right this figure here our goal is to right this figure here our goal is to right this figure here our goal is to find the shortest path between two nodes find the shortest path between two nodes find the shortest path between two nodes let's say we're trying to find the let's say we're trying to find the let's say we're trying to find the shortest path between node a and node D shortest path between node a and node D shortest path between node a and node D now each Edge if you can see has a now each Edge if you can see has a now each Edge if you can see has a number linked with it this number number linked with it this number number linked with it this number denotes the cost to Travers through that denotes the cost to Travers through that denotes the cost to Travers through that edge so we need to choose a policy to edge so we need to choose a policy to edge so we need to choose a policy to travel from a to d in such a way that travel from a to d in such a way that travel from a to d in such a way that our cost is minimum so in this problem our cost is minimum so in this problem our cost is minimum so in this problem the set of states are denoted by the the set of states are denoted by the the set of states are denoted by the nodes a b c d the action is to Traverse nodes a b c d the action is to Traverse nodes a b c d the action is to Traverse from one node to the other for example from one node to the other for example from one node to the other for example if you're going from a to c that is an if you're going from a to c that is an if you're going from a to c that is an action C to B is an action action b2d is action C to B is an action action b2d is action C to B is an action action b2d is another action now the reward is the another action now the reward is the another action now the reward is the cost represented by each Edge policy is cost represented by each Edge policy is cost represented by each Edge policy is a part taken to reach the destination so a part taken to reach the destination so a part taken to reach the destination so we need to make sure that we choose a we need to make sure that we choose a we need to make sure that we choose a policy in such a way that our cost is policy in such a way that our cost is policy in such a way that our cost is minimized so what you can do is you can minimized so what you can do is you can minimized so what you can do is you can start off at node a and you can take BB start off at node a and you can take BB start off at node a and you can take BB steps to reach your destination steps to reach your destination steps to reach your destination initially only the next possible node is initially only the next possible node is initially only the next possible node is visible to you so from a you can either visible to you so from a you can either visible to you so from a you can either go to b or you can go to C so if you go to b or you can go to C so if you go to b or you can go to C so if you follow the greedy approach and take the follow the greedy approach and take the follow the greedy approach and take the most Optimum step which is choosing a to most Optimum step which is choosing a to most Optimum step which is choosing a to c instead of choosing a to B to C now c instead of choosing a to B to C now c instead of choosing a to B to C now you're at node C and you want to you're at node C and you want to you're at node C and you want to Traverse to node D again you must choose Traverse to node D again you must choose Traverse to node D again you must choose your path very wisely so if you Travers your path very wisely so if you Travers your path very wisely so if you Travers from a to C and C to B and B to D your from a to C and C to B and B to D your from a to C and C to B and B to D your cost is the least but if you Traverse cost is the least but if you Traverse cost is the least but if you Traverse from a to c to D your cost will actually from a to c to D your cost will actually from a to c to D your cost will actually increase now you need to choose a policy increase now you need to choose a policy increase now you need to choose a policy that will minimize your cost over here that will minimize your cost over here that will minimize your cost over here so let's say for example the agent chose so let's say for example the agent chose so let's say for example the agent chose a to c to D right it came to node C and a to c to D right it came to node C and a to c to D right it came to node C and then it directly chose D now the policy then it directly chose D now the policy then it directly chose D now the policy followed by our agent in this problem is followed by our agent in this problem is followed by our agent in this problem is exploitation type because we didn't exploitation type because we didn't exploitation type because we didn't explore the other nodes we just selected explore the other nodes we just selected explore the other nodes we just selected three nodes and we traversed through three nodes and we traversed through three nodes and we traversed through them and the policy we followed is not them and the policy we followed is not them and the policy we followed is not actually an optimal policy we must actually an optimal policy we must actually an optimal policy we must always Explore More to find out the always Explore More to find out the always Explore More to find out the optimal policy even if the other nodes optimal policy even if the other nodes optimal policy even if the other nodes are not giving us any more reward or is are not giving us any more reward or is are not giving us any more reward or is actually increasing our cost we still actually increasing our cost we still actually increasing our cost we still have to explore and find out if those have to explore and find out if those have to explore and find out if those paths are actually better or that policy paths are actually better or that policy paths are actually better or that policy is actually better the method that we is actually better the method that we is actually better the method that we implemented Here is known as the policy implemented Here is known as the policy implemented Here is known as the policy based learning now the aim here is to based learning now the aim here is to based learning now the aim here is to find the best policy among all the find the best policy among all the find the best policy among all the possible policies so guys apart from possible policies so guys apart from possible policies so guys apart from policy based we also have value based policy based we also have value based policy based we also have value based approach and action based approach value approach and action based approach value approach and action based approach value based emphasizes on maximizing the based emphasizes on maximizing the based emphasizes on maximizing the rewards and in action base we emphasize rewards and in action base we emphasize rewards and in action base we emphasize on each action taken by the agent now a on each action taken by the agent now a on each action taken by the agent now a point to note is that all of these point to note is that all of these point to note is that all of these learning approaches have a simp end goal learning approaches have a simp end goal learning approaches have a simp end goal the end goal is to effectively guide the the end goal is to effectively guide the the end goal is to effectively guide the agent through the environment and agent through the environment and agent through the environment and acquire the most number of rewards so acquire the most number of rewards so acquire the most number of rewards so this was very simple to understand this was very simple to understand this was very simple to understand markov's decision process exploitation markov's decision process exploitation markov's decision process exploitation and exploration tradeoff and we also and exploration tradeoff and we also and exploration tradeoff and we also discussed the different reinforcement discussed the different reinforcement discussed the different reinforcement learning definitions right I hope all of learning definitions right I hope all of learning definitions right I hope all of this was understandable now let's move this was understandable now let's move this was understandable now let's move on and understand algorithm known as Q on and understand algorithm known as Q on and understand algorithm known as Q learning algorithm so guys Q learning is learning algorithm so guys Q learning is learning algorithm so guys Q learning is one of the most important algorithm Ms one of the most important algorithm Ms one of the most important algorithm Ms in reinforcement learning and we'll in reinforcement learning and we'll in reinforcement learning and we'll discuss this algorithm with the help of discuss this algorithm with the help of discuss this algorithm with the help of a small example right we'll study this a small example right we'll study this a small example right we'll study this example and then we'll implement the example and then we'll implement the example and then we'll implement the same example using Python and we'll see same example using Python and we'll see same example using Python and we'll see how it works so this is how our how it works so this is how our how it works so this is how our demonstration looks for now now the demonstration looks for now now the demonstration looks for now now the problem statement is to place an agent problem statement is to place an agent problem statement is to place an agent in any one of the rooms numbered 0 1 2 3 in any one of the rooms numbered 0 1 2 3 in any one of the rooms numbered 0 1 2 3 and 4 and the goal is for the agent to and 4 and the goal is for the agent to and 4 and the goal is for the agent to reach outside the building which is room reach outside the building which is room reach outside the building which is room number five so basically this 0 1 2 3 4 number five so basically this 0 1 2 3 4 number five so basically this 0 1 2 3 4 represents the building represents the building represents the building and five represents a room which is and five represents a room which is and five represents a room which is outside the building now all these rooms outside the building now all these rooms outside the building now all these rooms are connected by doors now these gaps are connected by doors now these gaps are connected by doors now these gaps that you see between the rooms are that you see between the rooms are that you see between the rooms are basically doors and each room is basically doors and each room is basically doors and each room is numbered from 0er to four the outside of numbered from 0er to four the outside of numbered from 0er to four the outside of the building can be thought of as a big the building can be thought of as a big the building can be thought of as a big room which is room number five now if room which is room number five now if room which is room number five now if you notice this diagram the door number you notice this diagram the door number you notice this diagram the door number one and door number four lead directly one and door number four lead directly one and door number four lead directly to room number five from one you can to room number five from one you can to room number five from one you can directly go to five and from four also directly go to five and from four also directly go to five and from four also you can directly go to five but if you you can directly go to five but if you you can directly go to five but if you want to go to five from room number two want to go to five from room number two want to go to five from room number two then you'll first have to go to room then you'll first have to go to room then you'll first have to go to room number three room number one and then number three room number one and then number three room number one and then room number five so these are indirect room number five so these are indirect room number five so these are indirect links direct links are from room number links direct links are from room number links direct links are from room number one and room number four so I hope all one and room number four so I hope all one and room number four so I hope all of you are clear with the problem of you are clear with the problem of you are clear with the problem statement you're basically going to have statement you're basically going to have statement you're basically going to have a reinforcement learning agent and that a reinforcement learning agent and that a reinforcement learning agent and that agent has to Traverse through all the agent has to Traverse through all the agent has to Traverse through all the rooms in such a way that he reaches room rooms in such a way that he reaches room rooms in such a way that he reaches room number five to solve this problem first number five to solve this problem first number five to solve this problem first what we'll do is we'll represent the what we'll do is we'll represent the what we'll do is we'll represent the rooms on a graph now each room is rooms on a graph now each room is rooms on a graph now each room is denoted as as a node and the links that denoted as as a node and the links that denoted as as a node and the links that are connecting these nodes are the doors are connecting these nodes are the doors are connecting these nodes are the doors all right so we have Node 1 to five and all right so we have Node 1 to five and all right so we have Node 1 to five and the links between each of these nodes the links between each of these nodes the links between each of these nodes represent the Dos so for example if you represent the Dos so for example if you represent the Dos so for example if you look at this graph over here you can see look at this graph over here you can see look at this graph over here you can see that there is a direct connection from 1 that there is a direct connection from 1 that there is a direct connection from 1 to 5 meaning that you can directly go to 5 meaning that you can directly go to 5 meaning that you can directly go from room number one to your goal which from room number one to your goal which from room number one to your goal which is room number five so if you want to go is room number five so if you want to go is room number five so if you want to go from room number 3 to 5 you can either from room number 3 to 5 you can either from room number 3 to 5 you can either go to room number one and then go to go to room number one and then go to go to room number one and then go to five or you can go from room number five or you can go from room number five or you can go from room number three to four and then to five so guys three to four and then to five so guys three to four and then to five so guys remember end goal is to reach room remember end goal is to reach room remember end goal is to reach room number five now to set the room number number five now to set the room number number five now to set the room number five as the goal State what we'll do is five as the goal State what we'll do is five as the goal State what we'll do is we'll associate a reward value to each we'll associate a reward value to each we'll associate a reward value to each door the doors that lead immediately to door the doors that lead immediately to door the doors that lead immediately to the goal will have an instant reward of the goal will have an instant reward of the goal will have an instant reward of 100 so basically 1 to five will have a 100 so basically 1 to five will have a 100 so basically 1 to five will have a reward of 100 and four to five will also reward of 100 and four to five will also reward of 100 and four to five will also have a reward of 100 now other doors have a reward of 100 now other doors have a reward of 100 now other doors that are not directly connected to the that are not directly connected to the that are not directly connected to the Target room will have a zero reward Target room will have a zero reward Target room will have a zero reward because they do not directly lead us to because they do not directly lead us to because they do not directly lead us to the goal so let's say you place the the goal so let's say you place the the goal so let's say you place the agent in room number three so to go from agent in room number three so to go from agent in room number three so to go from room number three to one the agent will room number three to one the agent will room number three to one the agent will get a reward of zero and to go from 1 to get a reward of zero and to go from 1 to get a reward of zero and to go from 1 to five the agent will get a reward of 100 five the agent will get a reward of 100 five the agent will get a reward of 100 now because the doors are two-way the now because the doors are two-way the now because the doors are two-way the two arrows are assigned to each room you two arrows are assigned to each room you two arrows are assigned to each room you can see an arrow going towards the room can see an arrow going towards the room can see an arrow going towards the room and one coming from the room so each and one coming from the room so each and one coming from the room so each Arrow contains an instant reward as Arrow contains an instant reward as Arrow contains an instant reward as shown in this figure now of course room shown in this figure now of course room shown in this figure now of course room number five will loop back to itself number five will loop back to itself number five will loop back to itself with a reward of 100 and all other with a reward of 100 and all other with a reward of 100 and all other direct connections to the Gold Room will direct connections to the Gold Room will direct connections to the Gold Room will carry a reward of 100 now in Q learning carry a reward of 100 now in Q learning carry a reward of 100 now in Q learning the goal is to reach the state with the the goal is to reach the state with the the goal is to reach the state with the highest reward so that if the agent highest reward so that if the agent highest reward so that if the agent arrives at the goal it will remain there arrives at the goal it will remain there arrives at the goal it will remain there forever so I hope all of you are clear forever so I hope all of you are clear forever so I hope all of you are clear with this diagram now the terminologies with this diagram now the terminologies with this diagram now the terminologies in Q learning include two terms State in Q learning include two terms State in Q learning include two terms State and action okay your room basically and action okay your room basically and action okay your room basically represents the state so if you're in represents the state so if you're in represents the state so if you're in state two it basically means that you're state two it basically means that you're state two it basically means that you're in room number two now the action is in room number two now the action is in room number two now the action is basic basically the movement of the basic basically the movement of the basic basically the movement of the agent from one room to the other room agent from one room to the other room agent from one room to the other room let's say you're going from room number let's say you're going from room number let's say you're going from room number two to room number three right that is two to room number three right that is two to room number three right that is basically an action now let's consider a basically an action now let's consider a basically an action now let's consider a small example let's say you place the small example let's say you place the small example let's say you place the agent in room number two and he has to agent in room number two and he has to agent in room number two and he has to get to the goal so your initial state get to the goal so your initial state get to the goal so your initial state will be state number two or room number will be state number two or room number will be state number two or room number two then from room number two you'll go two then from room number two you'll go two then from room number two you'll go to room number three which is state to room number three which is state to room number three which is state three then from state three you can three then from state three you can three then from state three you can either go back to state two or go to either go back to state two or go to either go back to state two or go to state 1 or state 4 if you go to state 4 state 1 or state 4 if you go to state 4 state 1 or state 4 if you go to state 4 from there you can directly go to your from there you can directly go to your from there you can directly go to your go room which is five this is how the go room which is five this is how the go room which is five this is how the agent is going to Traverse now in order agent is going to Traverse now in order agent is going to Traverse now in order to depict the rewards that you're going to depict the rewards that you're going to depict the rewards that you're going to get we're going to create a matrix to get we're going to create a matrix to get we're going to create a matrix known as the reward Matrix okay this is known as the reward Matrix okay this is known as the reward Matrix okay this is represented by r or also known as the r represented by r or also known as the r represented by r or also known as the r Matrix now the minus one in this table Matrix now the minus one in this table Matrix now the minus one in this table represents null values that is basically represents null values that is basically represents null values that is basically where there isn't a link between the where there isn't a link between the where there isn't a link between the nodes that is represented as minus one nodes that is represented as minus one nodes that is represented as minus one now there is no link between 0 and 0 now there is no link between 0 and 0 now there is no link between 0 and 0 that's why it's minus one now if you that's why it's minus one now if you that's why it's minus one now if you look at this diagram there is no direct look at this diagram there is no direct look at this diagram there is no direct link from 0 to one right that's why I've link from 0 to one right that's why I've link from 0 to one right that's why I've put minus one over here as well but if put minus one over here as well but if put minus one over here as well but if you look at 0 comma 4 we have a value of you look at 0 comma 4 we have a value of you look at 0 comma 4 we have a value of zero over here which means that you can zero over here which means that you can zero over here which means that you can Traverse from 0 to 4 but your reward is Traverse from 0 to 4 but your reward is Traverse from 0 to 4 but your reward is going to be zero because four is not going to be zero because four is not going to be zero because four is not your goal State however if you look at your goal State however if you look at your goal State however if you look at the Matrix look at 1 comma 5 in 1 comma the Matrix look at 1 comma 5 in 1 comma the Matrix look at 1 comma 5 in 1 comma 5 we have a reward value of 100 this is 5 we have a reward value of 100 this is 5 we have a reward value of 100 this is because you can directly go from room because you can directly go from room because you can directly go from room number one to five and five is the end number one to five and five is the end number one to five and five is the end goal that's why we have assigned a goal that's why we have assigned a goal that's why we have assigned a reward of 100 similarly for 4 comma 5 we reward of 100 similarly for 4 comma 5 we reward of 100 similarly for 4 comma 5 we have a reward of 100 and for 5 comma 5 have a reward of 100 and for 5 comma 5 have a reward of 100 and for 5 comma 5 we have a reward of 100 zeros basically we have a reward of 100 zeros basically we have a reward of 100 zeros basically represent other links but they are zero represent other links but they are zero represent other links but they are zero because they do not lead to the end goal because they do not lead to the end goal because they do not lead to the end goal so I hope you all understood the reward so I hope you all understood the reward so I hope you all understood the reward matrix it's very simple now before we matrix it's very simple now before we matrix it's very simple now before we move any further we'll be creating move any further we'll be creating move any further we'll be creating another Matrix known as the Q Matrix now another Matrix known as the Q Matrix now another Matrix known as the Q Matrix now the Q Matrix basically represents the the Q Matrix basically represents the the Q Matrix basically represents the memory of what the a agent has learned memory of what the a agent has learned memory of what the a agent has learned through experience the rows of the Q through experience the rows of the Q through experience the rows of the Q Matrix will represent the current state Matrix will represent the current state Matrix will represent the current state of the agent The Columns will represent of the agent The Columns will represent of the agent The Columns will represent the next possible actions leading to the the next possible actions leading to the the next possible actions leading to the next state and the formula to calculate next state and the formula to calculate next state and the formula to calculate the Q Matrix is this formula right here the Q Matrix is this formula right here the Q Matrix is this formula right here we have q State comma action R State we have q State comma action R State we have q State comma action R State comma action which is nothing but the comma action which is nothing but the comma action which is nothing but the reward Matrix then we have a parameter reward Matrix then we have a parameter reward Matrix then we have a parameter known as the gamma parameter which I'll known as the gamma parameter which I'll known as the gamma parameter which I'll explain shortly and then we are explain shortly and then we are explain shortly and then we are multiplying this with the maximum of Q multiplying this with the maximum of Q multiplying this with the maximum of Q next state comma all actions next state comma all actions next state comma all actions now don't worry if you haven't now don't worry if you haven't now don't worry if you haven't understood this formula I'll explain understood this formula I'll explain understood this formula I'll explain this with a small example for now let's this with a small example for now let's this with a small example for now let's understand what the gamma parameter is understand what the gamma parameter is understand what the gamma parameter is so basically the value of gamma will be so basically the value of gamma will be so basically the value of gamma will be between 0 and 1 if gamma is closer to between 0 and 1 if gamma is closer to between 0 and 1 if gamma is closer to zero it means that the agent will tend zero it means that the agent will tend zero it means that the agent will tend to consider only immediate rewards now to consider only immediate rewards now to consider only immediate rewards now if the gamma is closer to one It means if the gamma is closer to one It means if the gamma is closer to one It means that the agent will consider future that the agent will consider future that the agent will consider future rewards with greater weight now what rewards with greater weight now what rewards with greater weight now what exactly I'm trying to say is if gamma is exactly I'm trying to say is if gamma is exactly I'm trying to say is if gamma is closer to one then we'll be performing closer to one then we'll be performing closer to one then we'll be performing some something known as exploitation I some something known as exploitation I some something known as exploitation I hope you all remember what exploitation hope you all remember what exploitation hope you all remember what exploitation and exploration trade-off is so if your and exploration trade-off is so if your and exploration trade-off is so if your gamma is closer to zero it means that gamma is closer to zero it means that gamma is closer to zero it means that the agent is not going to explore the the agent is not going to explore the the agent is not going to explore the environment instead it'll just choose a environment instead it'll just choose a environment instead it'll just choose a couple of states and it'll just Traverse couple of states and it'll just Traverse couple of states and it'll just Traverse through those States but if your gamma through those States but if your gamma through those States but if your gamma parameter is closer to one It means that parameter is closer to one It means that parameter is closer to one It means that the agent will Traverse through all the agent will Traverse through all the agent will Traverse through all possible States meaning that it will possible States meaning that it will possible States meaning that it will perform exploration not exploitation so perform exploration not exploitation so perform exploration not exploitation so the closer your gamma parameter is to the closer your gamma parameter is to the closer your gamma parameter is to one the more your agent will explore one the more your agent will explore one the more your agent will explore this is exactly what gamma parameter is this is exactly what gamma parameter is this is exactly what gamma parameter is if you want to get the best policy it's if you want to get the best policy it's if you want to get the best policy it's always practical that you choose a gamma always practical that you choose a gamma always practical that you choose a gamma parameter which is closer to one we want parameter which is closer to one we want parameter which is closer to one we want the agent to explore the environment as the agent to explore the environment as the agent to explore the environment as much as possible so that it can get the much as possible so that it can get the much as possible so that it can get the best policy and the maximum rewards I best policy and the maximum rewards I best policy and the maximum rewards I hope this is clear now let me just tell hope this is clear now let me just tell hope this is clear now let me just tell you what the Q learning algorithm is you what the Q learning algorithm is you what the Q learning algorithm is step by step so you begin the Q learning step by step so you begin the Q learning step by step so you begin the Q learning algorithm by setting the gamma parameter algorithm by setting the gamma parameter algorithm by setting the gamma parameter and the environment rewards in Matrix R and the environment rewards in Matrix R and the environment rewards in Matrix R okay so first you'll have to set these okay so first you'll have to set these okay so first you'll have to set these two values we've already calculated the two values we've already calculated the two values we've already calculated the reward Matrix we need to set the gamma reward Matrix we need to set the gamma reward Matrix we need to set the gamma parameter next you'll initialize the parameter next you'll initialize the parameter next you'll initialize the Matrix Q to zero now why do you do this Matrix Q to zero now why do you do this Matrix Q to zero now why do you do this now if you remember I said that Q Matrix now if you remember I said that Q Matrix now if you remember I said that Q Matrix is basically the memory of the agent is basically the memory of the agent is basically the memory of the agent initially obviously the agent has no initially obviously the agent has no initially obviously the agent has no memory of the environment it's new to memory of the environment it's new to memory of the environment it's new to the environment and you're placing it the environment and you're placing it the environment and you're placing it randomly anywhere so it has zero memory randomly anywhere so it has zero memory randomly anywhere so it has zero memory that's why you initialize ize The Matrix that's why you initialize ize The Matrix that's why you initialize ize The Matrix Q to zero after that you'll select a Q to zero after that you'll select a Q to zero after that you'll select a random initial State and you'll place random initial State and you'll place random initial State and you'll place your agent in that initial State then your agent in that initial State then your agent in that initial State then you'll set this initial State as your you'll set this initial State as your you'll set this initial State as your current state now from the current state current state now from the current state current state now from the current state you'll select some action that will lead you'll select some action that will lead you'll select some action that will lead you to the next state then you'll you to the next state then you'll you to the next state then you'll basically get the maximum Q value for basically get the maximum Q value for basically get the maximum Q value for this next state based on all the this next state based on all the this next state based on all the possible actions that you take then possible actions that you take then possible actions that you take then you'll keep Computing this Q value until you'll keep Computing this Q value until you'll keep Computing this Q value until you reach the goal State now that might you reach the goal State now that might you reach the goal State now that might be a little bit confusing so let's look be a little bit confusing so let's look be a little bit confusing so let's look at the this entire thing with a small at the this entire thing with a small at the this entire thing with a small example let's say that first you're example let's say that first you're example let's say that first you're going to begin with setting your gamma going to begin with setting your gamma going to begin with setting your gamma parameter so I've set my gamma parameter parameter so I've set my gamma parameter parameter so I've set my gamma parameter to 0.8 which is pretty close to one this to 0.8 which is pretty close to one this to 0.8 which is pretty close to one this means that our agent will explore the means that our agent will explore the means that our agent will explore the environment as much as possible and also environment as much as possible and also environment as much as possible and also I'm setting the initial State as room I'm setting the initial State as room I'm setting the initial State as room one meaning I'm in state one or I'm in one meaning I'm in state one or I'm in one meaning I'm in state one or I'm in room one so basically your agent is room one so basically your agent is room one so basically your agent is going to be in room number one the next going to be in room number one the next going to be in room number one the next step is to initialize the Q Matrix as step is to initialize the Q Matrix as step is to initialize the Q Matrix as zero Matrix so this is our Q Matrix you zero Matrix so this is our Q Matrix you zero Matrix so this is our Q Matrix you you can see that everything is set to you can see that everything is set to you can see that everything is set to zero because the agent has no memory at zero because the agent has no memory at zero because the agent has no memory at all he hasn't traversed to any node so all he hasn't traversed to any node so all he hasn't traversed to any node so he has no memory now since the agent is he has no memory now since the agent is he has no memory now since the agent is in room one he can either go to room in room one he can either go to room in room one he can either go to room number three or he can go to room number number three or he can go to room number number three or he can go to room number five let's randomly select room number five let's randomly select room number five let's randomly select room number five so from room number five you're five so from room number five you're five so from room number five you're going to calculate the maximum Q value going to calculate the maximum Q value going to calculate the maximum Q value for the next state based on all possible for the next state based on all possible for the next state based on all possible actions so all the possible actions from actions so all the possible actions from actions so all the possible actions from room number five is 1 4 and 5 room number five is 1 4 and 5 room number five is 1 4 and 5 so basically we're traversing from Q 1 so basically we're traversing from Q 1 so basically we're traversing from Q 1 comma 5 that's why I put 1A 5 over here comma 5 that's why I put 1A 5 over here comma 5 that's why I put 1A 5 over here State comma action your reward Matrix State comma action your reward Matrix State comma action your reward Matrix will have r1a 5 now R1 comma 5 is will have r1a 5 now R1 comma 5 is will have r1a 5 now R1 comma 5 is basically 100 that's why I put 100 over basically 100 that's why I put 100 over basically 100 that's why I put 100 over here now your gamma parameter is 0.8 so here now your gamma parameter is 0.8 so here now your gamma parameter is 0.8 so guys what I'm doing here is I'm just guys what I'm doing here is I'm just guys what I'm doing here is I'm just substituting the values in this formula substituting the values in this formula substituting the values in this formula so let me just repeat this whole thing Q so let me just repeat this whole thing Q so let me just repeat this whole thing Q State comma action so you in state State comma action so you in state State comma action so you in state number one correct and your action is number one correct and your action is number one correct and your action is you're going to R number five so your Q you're going to R number five so your Q you're going to R number five so your Q State comma action is 1A 5 again your State comma action is 1A 5 again your State comma action is 1A 5 again your reward Matrix R 1A 5 is 100 so here reward Matrix R 1A 5 is 100 so here reward Matrix R 1A 5 is 100 so here you're going to put 100 plus your gamma you're going to put 100 plus your gamma you're going to put 100 plus your gamma parameter your gamma parameter is parameter your gamma parameter is parameter your gamma parameter is 0.8 then you're going to calculate the 0.8 then you're going to calculate the 0.8 then you're going to calculate the maximum Q value for the next state based maximum Q value for the next state based maximum Q value for the next state based on all possible actions so let's look at on all possible actions so let's look at on all possible actions so let's look at the next state from room number five you the next state from room number five you the next state from room number five you can go to either 1 you can go to four or can go to either 1 you can go to four or can go to either 1 you can go to four or you can go to five so your actions are 5 you can go to five so your actions are 5 you can go to five so your actions are 5 comma 1 5 5A 4 and 5A 5 that's exactly comma 1 5 5A 4 and 5A 5 that's exactly comma 1 5 5A 4 and 5A 5 that's exactly what I mentioned over here q5a 1 Q 5A 4 what I mentioned over here q5a 1 Q 5A 4 what I mentioned over here q5a 1 Q 5A 4 and q5a five you're basically putting and q5a five you're basically putting and q5a five you're basically putting all the next possible actions from state all the next possible actions from state all the next possible actions from state number five from here you'll calculate number five from here you'll calculate number five from here you'll calculate the maximum Q value that you're getting the maximum Q value that you're getting the maximum Q value that you're getting for each of these now your Q value is for each of these now your Q value is for each of these now your Q value is zero because initially your Q Matrix is zero because initially your Q Matrix is zero because initially your Q Matrix is set to zero so you're going to get Zer set to zero so you're going to get Zer set to zero so you're going to get Zer for Q 5A 1 5aa 4 and 5A 5 so that's why for Q 5A 1 5aa 4 and 5A 5 so that's why for Q 5A 1 5aa 4 and 5A 5 so that's why you'll get 0.8 into 0 you'll get 0.8 into 0 you'll get 0.8 into 0 and hence your q1a 5 becomes 100 this and hence your q1a 5 becomes 100 this and hence your q1a 5 becomes 100 this 100 comes from R 1A 5 right I hope all 100 comes from R 1A 5 right I hope all 100 comes from R 1A 5 right I hope all of you understood this so next what of you understood this so next what of you understood this so next what you'll do is you'll update this 1 comma you'll do is you'll update this 1 comma you'll do is you'll update this 1 comma 5 value in your Q Matrix because you 5 value in your Q Matrix because you 5 value in your Q Matrix because you just calculated Q 1A 5 so I've updated just calculated Q 1A 5 so I've updated just calculated Q 1A 5 so I've updated it over here now for the next episode it over here now for the next episode it over here now for the next episode we'll start with a randomly chosen we'll start with a randomly chosen we'll start with a randomly chosen initial state right again let's say that initial state right again let's say that initial state right again let's say that we randomly chose state number three now we randomly chose state number three now we randomly chose state number three now from room number three you can either go from room number three you can either go from room number three you can either go to room number one 2 or 4 let's randomly to room number one 2 or 4 let's randomly to room number one 2 or 4 let's randomly select room number one now from room select room number one now from room select room number one now from room number five you calculate the maximum Q number five you calculate the maximum Q number five you calculate the maximum Q value for the next possible actions so value for the next possible actions so value for the next possible actions so let's calculate the Q formula for this let's calculate the Q formula for this let's calculate the Q formula for this so your Q State comma action becomes 3 so your Q State comma action becomes 3 so your Q State comma action becomes 3 comma 1 because you're in state number comma 1 because you're in state number comma 1 because you're in state number three and your action is you're going to three and your action is you're going to three and your action is you're going to room number one so your R3 comma 1 let's room number one so your R3 comma 1 let's room number one so your R3 comma 1 let's see what R3 comma 1 is R3 comma 1 is see what R3 comma 1 is R3 comma 1 is see what R3 comma 1 is R3 comma 1 is zero so you're going to put zero over zero so you're going to put zero over zero so you're going to put zero over here plus your gamma parameter which is here plus your gamma parameter which is here plus your gamma parameter which is 0.8 and then you're going to check the 0.8 and then you're going to check the 0.8 and then you're going to check the next possible actions from room number next possible actions from room number next possible actions from room number one and you're going to choose the one and you're going to choose the one and you're going to choose the maximum value from these two so q1a 3 maximum value from these two so q1a 3 maximum value from these two so q1a 3 and q1a 5 denote your next possible and q1a 5 denote your next possible and q1a 5 denote your next possible actions from room number one so q1a 3 is actions from room number one so q1a 3 is actions from room number one so q1a 3 is 0er but q1a 5 is 100 so we just 0er but q1a 5 is 100 so we just 0er but q1a 5 is 100 so we just calculated this 100 in the previous step calculated this 100 in the previous step calculated this 100 in the previous step so out of 0 and 100 100 is your maximum so out of 0 and 100 100 is your maximum so out of 0 and 100 100 is your maximum value so you're going to choose 100 now value so you're going to choose 100 now value so you're going to choose 100 now 0. 8 into 100 is nothing but 80 so again 0. 8 into 100 is nothing but 80 so again 0. 8 into 100 is nothing but 80 so again your Q Matrix gets updated right you see your Q Matrix gets updated right you see your Q Matrix gets updated right you see an 80 over here so basically what you're an 80 over here so basically what you're an 80 over here so basically what you're doing is as you're taking actions you're doing is as you're taking actions you're doing is as you're taking actions you're updating your Q value you're just updating your Q value you're just updating your Q value you're just calculating the Q value at every step calculating the Q value at every step calculating the Q value at every step you're putting it in your Q Matrix so you're putting it in your Q Matrix so you're putting it in your Q Matrix so that your agent remembers that okay when that your agent remembers that okay when that your agent remembers that okay when I went from room number one to room I went from room number one to room I went from room number one to room number five I had a q value of 100 number five I had a q value of 100 number five I had a q value of 100 similarly 3: 1 gave me a q value of 80 similarly 3: 1 gave me a q value of 80 similarly 3: 1 gave me a q value of 80 so basically this Q Matrix represents so basically this Q Matrix represents so basically this Q Matrix represents the memory of your agent I hope all of the memory of your agent I hope all of the memory of your agent I hope all of you are clear with this so basically you are clear with this so basically you are clear with this so basically what we're going to do is we're going to what we're going to do is we're going to what we're going to do is we're going to keep iterating through this Loop until keep iterating through this Loop until keep iterating through this Loop until we've gone through all possible States we've gone through all possible States we've gone through all possible States and reach the goal state which is five and reach the goal state which is five and reach the goal state which is five also our main aim here is to find the also our main aim here is to find the also our main aim here is to find the most Optimum policy to get to room most Optimum policy to get to room most Optimum policy to get to room number five now let's implement the number five now let's implement the number five now let's implement the exact same thing using python so that exact same thing using python so that exact same thing using python so that was a lot of theory now let's understand was a lot of theory now let's understand was a lot of theory now let's understand how this is done practically all right how this is done practically all right how this is done practically all right so we begin by importing your Library so we begin by importing your Library so we begin by importing your Library all right we're going to be using the all right we're going to be using the all right we're going to be using the numpy library over here after that we'll numpy library over here after that we'll numpy library over here after that we'll input the r Matrix we've already created input the r Matrix we've already created input the r Matrix we've already created the r Matrix this is the exact reward the r Matrix this is the exact reward the r Matrix this is the exact reward Matrix that I showed you a couple of Matrix that I showed you a couple of Matrix that I showed you a couple of minutes ago right so I've created a minutes ago right so I've created a minutes ago right so I've created a matrix called R and I've basically matrix called R and I've basically matrix called R and I've basically stored all the rewards in it right if stored all the rewards in it right if stored all the rewards in it right if you want to see the r Matrix let me you want to see the r Matrix let me you want to see the r Matrix let me print it so basically this is your R Matrix it so basically this is your R Matrix right right if you remember Node 1 to 5 right right if you remember Node 1 to 5 right right if you remember Node 1 to 5 you have a reward of 100 node 4 to 5 you you have a reward of 100 node 4 to 5 you you have a reward of 100 node 4 to 5 you have a reward of 100 and 5 to 5 you have have a reward of 100 and 5 to 5 you have have a reward of 100 and 5 to 5 you have a reward of 100 because all of these a reward of 100 because all of these a reward of 100 because all of these nodes directly lead us to the reward nodes directly lead us to the reward nodes directly lead us to the reward correct next what we're doing is we're correct next what we're doing is we're correct next what we're doing is we're creating a q Matrix which is basically a creating a q Matrix which is basically a creating a q Matrix which is basically a 6 into six Matrix which represents all 6 into six Matrix which represents all 6 into six Matrix which represents all the states 0 to 5 and this Matrix is the states 0 to 5 and this Matrix is the states 0 to 5 and this Matrix is basically zero after that we're setting basically zero after that we're setting basically zero after that we're setting the gamma parameter now guys you can the gamma parameter now guys you can the gamma parameter now guys you can play around with this code and you know play around with this code and you know play around with this code and you know you can change the gamma parameter to you can change the gamma parameter to you can change the gamma parameter to 0.7 or 0.9 and see how much more the 0.7 or 0.9 and see how much more the 0.7 or 0.9 and see how much more the agent will explore or whether it will agent will explore or whether it will agent will explore or whether it will perform exploitation here I've set the perform exploitation here I've set the perform exploitation here I've set the gamma parameter 0.8 which is a pretty gamma parameter 0.8 which is a pretty gamma parameter 0.8 which is a pretty good number now what I'm doing is I'm good number now what I'm doing is I'm good number now what I'm doing is I'm setting the initial State as one all setting the initial State as one all setting the initial State as one all right you can randomly choose this state right you can randomly choose this state right you can randomly choose this state according to your needs I've set the according to your needs I've set the according to your needs I've set the initial State as one now this function initial State as one now this function initial State as one now this function will basically give me all the available will basically give me all the available will basically give me all the available actions from my initial State okay since actions from my initial State okay since actions from my initial State okay since I've set my initial State as one it will I've set my initial State as one it will I've set my initial State as one it will give me all the possible actions here give me all the possible actions here give me all the possible actions here what I'm doing is since my initial state what I'm doing is since my initial state what I'm doing is since my initial state is one I'm checking in my row number one is one I'm checking in my row number one is one I'm checking in my row number one which value is equal to Zer or greater which value is equal to Zer or greater which value is equal to Zer or greater than zero those denote my available than zero those denote my available than zero those denote my available actions right so look at our row number actions right so look at our row number actions right so look at our row number one here we have 1 Zer and we have a 100 one here we have 1 Zer and we have a 100 one here we have 1 Zer and we have a 100 over here this is 1A 4 and this is 1A 5 over here this is 1A 4 and this is 1A 5 over here this is 1A 4 and this is 1A 5 so if you look at the row number one so if you look at the row number one so if you look at the row number one since I've selected the initial State as since I've selected the initial State as since I've selected the initial State as one we'll consider row number one one we'll consider row number one one we'll consider row number one okay what I'm doing is in row number one okay what I'm doing is in row number one okay what I'm doing is in row number one I have two numbers which are either I have two numbers which are either I have two numbers which are either equal to zero or greater than zero these equal to zero or greater than zero these equal to zero or greater than zero these denote my possible actions 1A 3 has a denote my possible actions 1A 3 has a denote my possible actions 1A 3 has a value of 0er and 1A 5 has a value of 100 value of 0er and 1A 5 has a value of 100 value of 0er and 1A 5 has a value of 100 which means that the agent can either go which means that the agent can either go which means that the agent can either go to room number three or it can go to to room number three or it can go to to room number three or it can go to room number five what I'm trying to say room number five what I'm trying to say room number five what I'm trying to say is from room number one you can is from room number one you can is from room number one you can basically go to room number three or basically go to room number three or basically go to room number three or room number five this is exactly what room number five this is exactly what room number five this is exactly what I've coded over here I've coded over here I've coded over here right if you remember the reward Matrix right if you remember the reward Matrix right if you remember the reward Matrix from one you can Traverse to only room from one you can Traverse to only room from one you can Traverse to only room number three directly and room number number three directly and room number number three directly and room number five directly okay that's exactly what five directly okay that's exactly what five directly okay that's exactly what I've mentioned in my code over here so I've mentioned in my code over here so I've mentioned in my code over here so this will basically give me the this will basically give me the this will basically give me the available actions from my current available actions from my current available actions from my current state now once I've moved to my next state now once I've moved to my next state now once I've moved to my next state I need to check the available state I need to check the available state I need to check the available actions from that state what I'm doing actions from that state what I'm doing actions from that state what I'm doing over here is basically this right if you over here is basically this right if you over here is basically this right if you remember from room number one we can go remember from room number one we can go remember from room number one we can go to three and five correct and from three to three and five correct and from three to three and five correct and from three and five I'll randomly select a state and five I'll randomly select a state and five I'll randomly select a state and from that state I need to find out and from that state I need to find out and from that state I need to find out all possible actions that's exactly what all possible actions that's exactly what all possible actions that's exactly what I've done over here okay now this will I've done over here okay now this will I've done over here okay now this will randomly choose an action for me from randomly choose an action for me from randomly choose an action for me from all my available actions all right next all my available actions all right next all my available actions all right next we need to update our Q Matrix depending we need to update our Q Matrix depending we need to update our Q Matrix depending on the actions that we took if you on the actions that we took if you on the actions that we took if you remember right so that's exactly what remember right so that's exactly what remember right so that's exactly what this update function is for now guys this update function is for now guys this update function is for now guys this this this entire is for calculating the Q value I entire is for calculating the Q value I entire is for calculating the Q value I hope all of you remember the formula hope all of you remember the formula hope all of you remember the formula which is Q State comma action R State which is Q State comma action R State which is Q State comma action R State comma action plus gamma into max value comma action plus gamma into max value comma action plus gamma into max value max value will basically give me the max value will basically give me the max value will basically give me the maximum value out of the all possible maximum value out of the all possible maximum value out of the all possible actions I'm basically Computing this actions I'm basically Computing this actions I'm basically Computing this formula now this will just update the Q formula now this will just update the Q formula now this will just update the Q Matrix coming to the training phase what Matrix coming to the training phase what Matrix coming to the training phase what we're going to do is we are going to set we're going to do is we are going to set we're going to do is we are going to set a range here I've set a range of 10,000 a range here I've set a range of 10,000 a range here I've set a range of 10,000 meaning that my agent will perform meaning that my agent will perform meaning that my agent will perform 10,000 iterations you can set this 10,000 iterations you can set this 10,000 iterations you can set this depending on your own needs and 10,000 depending on your own needs and 10,000 depending on your own needs and 10,000 iterations is a pretty huge number right iterations is a pretty huge number right iterations is a pretty huge number right so basically my agent is going to go so basically my agent is going to go so basically my agent is going to go through 10,000 possible iterations in through 10,000 possible iterations in through 10,000 possible iterations in order to find the best policy right now order to find the best policy right now order to find the best policy right now this is the exact same thing that we did this is the exact same thing that we did this is the exact same thing that we did earlier we're setting the current state earlier we're setting the current state earlier we're setting the current state and then we're choosing the available and then we're choosing the available and then we're choosing the available action from the current state then from action from the current state then from action from the current state then from there we'll choose a action at random there we'll choose a action at random there we'll choose a action at random here we'll calculate the Q value and here we'll calculate the Q value and here we'll calculate the Q value and we'll update the Q value in The Matrix we'll update the Q value in The Matrix we'll update the Q value in The Matrix all right and here I'm doing nothing but all right and here I'm doing nothing but all right and here I'm doing nothing but I'm printing the trained Q Matrix all I'm printing the trained Q Matrix all I'm printing the trained Q Matrix all right this was the training phase now right this was the training phase now right this was the training phase now the testing phase basically you're going the testing phase basically you're going the testing phase basically you're going to randomly choose a current state all to randomly choose a current state all to randomly choose a current state all right you're going to choose a current right you're going to choose a current right you're going to choose a current state and you're going to keep looping state and you're going to keep looping state and you're going to keep looping through this entire code until you reach through this entire code until you reach through this entire code until you reach the goal state which is room number five the goal state which is room number five the goal state which is room number five that's exactly what I'm doing in this that's exactly what I'm doing in this that's exactly what I'm doing in this whole thing also in the end I'm printing whole thing also in the end I'm printing whole thing also in the end I'm printing the selected path that is basically the the selected path that is basically the the selected path that is basically the policy that the agent took to reach room policy that the agent took to reach room policy that the agent took to reach room number five now if I set the current number five now if I set the current number five now if I set the current state as one it should give me the best state as one it should give me the best state as one it should give me the best policy to reach to room number five from policy to reach to room number five from policy to reach to room number five from room number one all right let's run this room number one all right let's run this room number one all right let's run this code and let's see if it's giving us code and let's see if it's giving us code and let's see if it's giving us that now before that happens I want you that now before that happens I want you that now before that happens I want you to check and tell me which is the best to check and tell me which is the best to check and tell me which is the best possible way to get from room number one possible way to get from room number one possible way to get from room number one to room number five it's obviously to room number five it's obviously to room number five it's obviously directly like this right 1 to five is directly like this right 1 to five is directly like this right 1 to five is the best policy to get from room number the best policy to get from room number the best policy to get from room number one to room number five right so we one to room number five right so we one to room number five right so we should get an output of 1 comma 5 right should get an output of 1 comma 5 right should get an output of 1 comma 5 right right that's exactly what we're getting right that's exactly what we're getting right that's exactly what we're getting this is our Q Matrix with all the Q this is our Q Matrix with all the Q this is our Q Matrix with all the Q values and here we getting the selected values and here we getting the selected values and here we getting the selected path so if your current state is one path so if your current state is one path so if your current state is one your best policy is to go from 1 to five your best policy is to go from 1 to five your best policy is to go from 1 to five now if you want to change your current now if you want to change your current now if you want to change your current state let's say we set the current state state let's say we set the current state state let's say we set the current state to two now before we run the code let's to two now before we run the code let's to two now before we run the code let's see which is the best possible way to see which is the best possible way to see which is the best possible way to get to room number five from room number get to room number five from room number get to room number five from room number two from room number two you can go to two from room number two you can go to two from room number two you can go to three then you can go to one and then three then you can go to one and then three then you can go to one and then you can go to five you can go to five you can go to five right this will give you a reward of 100 right this will give you a reward of 100 right this will give you a reward of 100 or you can go to room number three then or you can go to room number three then or you can go to room number three then go to four and then go to five right go to four and then go to five right go to four and then go to five right this will also give you a reward of 100 this will also give you a reward of 100 this will also give you a reward of 100 our path should be something like that our path should be something like that our path should be something like that let's save it and let's run the let's save it and let's run the let's save it and let's run the file so basically from state two you're file so basically from state two you're file so basically from state two you're going to state three then to four and going to state three then to four and going to state three then to four and then to five this is our best possible then to five this is our best possible then to five this is our best possible path from two to room number five so path from two to room number five so path from two to room number five so guys this is exactly how the Q learning guys this is exactly how the Q learning guys this is exactly how the Q learning algorithm works and this was a simple algorithm works and this was a simple algorithm works and this was a simple implementation of the entire example implementation of the entire example implementation of the entire example that I just told you now if any of you that I just told you now if any of you

understood learning model we've understood reinforcement learning supervised reinforcement learning supervised reinforcement learning supervised learning unsupervised learning and so on learning unsupervised learning and so on learning unsupervised learning and so on before I get to deep learning I want to before I get to deep learning I want to before I get to deep learning I want to clear a very common misconception right clear a very common misconception right clear a very common misconception right A lot of people get confused between AI A lot of people get confused between AI A lot of people get confused between AI machine learning and deep learning machine learning and deep learning machine learning and deep learning because you know artificial intelligence because you know artificial intelligence because you know artificial intelligence machine learning and deep learning have machine learning and deep learning have machine learning and deep learning have very common applications for example very common applications for example very common applications for example Siri is an application of artificial Siri is an application of artificial Siri is an application of artificial intelligence machine learning and deep intelligence machine learning and deep intelligence machine learning and deep learning so how are these three learning so how are these three learning so how are these three connected are they the same thing or how connected are they the same thing or how connected are they the same thing or how exactly is the relationship between exactly is the relationship between exactly is the relationship between artificial intelligence machine learning artificial intelligence machine learning artificial intelligence machine learning and deep learning this is what I'll be and deep learning this is what I'll be and deep learning this is what I'll be discussing now artificial intelligence discussing now artificial intelligence discussing now artificial intelligence is basically the science of getting is basically the science of getting is basically the science of getting machines to mimic the behavior of human machines to mimic the behavior of human machines to mimic the behavior of human beings all right but when it comes to beings all right but when it comes to beings all right but when it comes to machine learning machine learning is a machine learning machine learning is a machine learning machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that subset of artificial intelligence that subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on getting machines to make focuses on getting machines to make focuses on getting machines to make decisions by feeding them data all right decisions by feeding them data all right decisions by feeding them data all right that's exactly what machine learning is that's exactly what machine learning is that's exactly what machine learning is it is a subset of artificial it is a subset of artificial it is a subset of artificial intelligence deep learning on the other intelligence deep learning on the other intelligence deep learning on the other hand is a subset of

problems right that's how AI datadriven problems right that's how AI datadriven problems right that's how AI machine learning and deep learning are machine learning and deep learning are machine learning and deep learning are related I hope all of you have cleared related I hope all of you have cleared related I hope all of you have cleared your misconceptions and doubts about AI your misconceptions and doubts about AI your misconceptions and doubts about AI ML and deep learning now let's look at ML and deep learning now let's look at ML and deep learning now let's look at our next topic which is limitations of our next topic which is limitations of our next topic which is limitations of machine learning now the first machine learning now the first machine learning now the first limitation is machine learning is not limitation is machine learning is not limitation is machine learning is not capable enough to handle High capable enough to handle High capable enough to handle High dimensional data this is where the input dimensional data this is where the input dimensional data this is where the input and the output is very large so handling and the output is very large so handling and the output is very large so handling and processing such type of data becomes and processing such type of data becomes and processing such type of data becomes very complex and it takes up a lot of very complex and it takes up a lot of very complex and it takes up a lot of resources this is also sometimes known resources this is also sometimes known resources this is also sometimes known as the curse of dimensionality so to as the curse of dimensionality so to as the curse of dimensionality so to understand this in simpler terms look at understand this in simpler terms look at understand this in simpler terms look at the image shown on this slide consider a the image shown on this slide consider a the image shown on this slide consider a line of 100 yards and let's say that you line of 100 yards and let's say that you line of 100 yards and let's say that you dropped a coin somewhere on the line now dropped a coin somewhere on the line now dropped a coin somewhere on the line now it's quite convenient for you to find it's quite convenient for you to find it's quite convenient for you to find the coin by simply walking along the the coin by simply walking along the the coin by simply walking along the line this is very simple because this line this is very simple because this line this is very simple because this line is considered as single dimensional line is considered as single dimensional line is considered as single dimensional entity now next you consider that you entity now next you consider that you entity now next you consider that you have a square of 100 yards and let's say have a square of 100 yards and let's say have a square of 100 yards and let's say You Dropped a coin somewhere in between You Dropped a coin somewhere in between You Dropped a coin somewhere in between now it's quite evident that you're going now it's quite evident that you're going now it's quite evident that you're going to take more time to find the coin to take more time to find the coin to take more time to find the coin within that square as compared to the within that square as compared to the within that square as compared to the previous scenario the square is let's previous scenario the square is let's previous scenario the square is let's say a two-dimensional entity let's take say a two-dimensional entity let's take say a two-dimensional entity let's take it a step ahead and let's consider a it a step ahead and let's consider a it a step ahead and let's consider a cube okay let's say there's a cube cube cube okay let's say there's a cube cube cube okay let's say there's a cube cube of side 100 yards and you have dropped a of side 100 yards and you have dropped a of side 100 yards and you have dropped a coin somewhere in between this Cube now coin somewhere in between this Cube now coin somewhere in between this Cube now it becomes even more difficult for you it becomes even more difficult for you it becomes even more difficult for you to find the coin this time because this to find the coin this time because this to find the coin this time because this is a three-dimensional entity so as your is a three-dimensional entity so as your is a three-dimensional entity so as your dimension increases the problem becomes dimension increases the problem becomes dimension increases the problem becomes more complex so if You observe that the more complex so if You observe that the more complex so if You observe that the complexity is increasing with the complexity is increasing with the complexity is increasing with the increase in your dimensions and in real increase in your dimensions and in real increase in your dimensions and in real life the high dimensional data that life the high dimensional data that life the high dimensional data that we're talking about has thousands of we're talking about has thousands of we're talking about has thousands of Dimensions that makes it very complex to Dimensions that makes it very complex to Dimensions that makes it very complex to handle and process now the high handle and process now the high handle and process now the high dimensional data can easily be found in dimensional data can easily be found in dimensional data can easily be found in use cases like image processing natural use cases like image processing natural use cases like image processing natural language processing image translation language processing image translation language processing image translation and so on now in K means itself we saw and so on now in K means itself we saw and so on now in K means itself we saw that we had 16 million possible colors that we had 16 million possible colors that we had 16 million possible colors right that is a lot of data so this is right that is a lot of data so this is right that is a lot of data so this is why machine learning is restricted it why machine learning is restricted it why machine learning is restricted it cannot be used in the process of image cannot be used in the process of image cannot be used in the process of image recognition because image recognition recognition because image recognition recognition because image recognition and images have a lot of pixels and they and images have a lot of pixels and they and images have a lot of pixels and they have a lot of high dimensional data have a lot of high dimensional data have a lot of high dimensional data right that's why machine learning right that's why machine learning right that's why machine learning becomes very restrictive when it comes becomes very restrictive when it comes becomes very restrictive when it comes to such use cases now the second major to such use cases now the second major to such use cases now the second major challenge is to tell the computer what challenge is to tell the computer what challenge is to tell the computer what are the features it should look for that are the features it should look for that are the features it should look for that will play an important role in will play an important role in will play an important role in predicting the outcome and in getting a predicting the outcome and in getting a predicting the outcome and in getting a good accuracy now this process is good accuracy now this process is good accuracy now this process is something known as feature extraction something known as feature extraction something known as feature extraction now feeding raw data to the algorithm now feeding raw data to the algorithm now feeding raw data to the algorithm rarely works and this is the reason why rarely works and this is the reason why rarely works and this is the reason why feature extraction is a critical part of feature extraction is a critical part of feature extraction is a critical part of machine learning workflow now the machine learning workflow now the machine learning workflow now the challenge for the programmer here challenge for the programmer here challenge for the programmer here increases because the effectiveness of increases because the effectiveness of increases because the effectiveness of the algorithm depends on how insightful the algorithm depends on how insightful the algorithm depends on how insightful the programmer is as a programmer you the programmer is as a programmer you the programmer is as a programmer you have to tell the machine that these are have to tell the machine that these are have to tell the machine that these are the features and depending on these the features and depending on these the features and depending on these features you have to predict the outcome features you have to predict the outcome features you have to predict the outcome right that's how machine learning works right that's how machine learning works right that's how machine learning works so far in all our demos we saw that we so far in all our demos we saw that we so far in all our demos we saw that we were providing predictor variables we were providing predictor variables we were providing predictor variables we were providing input variables that will were providing input variables that will were providing input variables that will help us predict the outcome right we help us predict the outcome right we help us predict the outcome right we were trying to find correlations between were trying to find correlations between were trying to find correlations between variables and we were trying to find out variables and we were trying to find out variables and we were trying to find out the variable that is very important in the variable that is very important in the variable that is very important in predicting the output variable so this predicting the output variable so this predicting the output variable so this becomes a challenge for the programmer becomes a challenge for the programmer becomes a challenge for the programmer that's why it's very difficult to apply that's why it's very difficult to apply that's why it's very difficult to apply machine learning models to complex machine learning models to complex machine learning models to complex problems like object recognition problems like object recognition problems like object recognition handwriting recognition natural language handwriting recognition natural language handwriting recognition natural language processing and so on now all these processing and so on now all these processing and so on now all these problems and all these limitations in problems and all these limitations in problems and all these limitations in machine learning led to the introduction machine learning led to the introduction machine learning led to the introduction of deep learning now we're going to of deep learning now we're going to of deep learning now we're going to discuss about deep learning now deep discuss about deep learning now deep discuss about deep learning now deep learning is one of the only methods by learning is one of the only methods by learning is one of the only methods by which we can overcome the challenges of which we can overcome the challenges of which we can overcome the challenges of feature extraction this is Because deep feature extraction this is Because deep feature extraction this is Because deep learning models are capable of learning learning models are capable of learning learning models are capable of learning to focus on the right features by to focus on the right features by to focus on the right features by themselves which requires very little themselves which requires very little themselves which requires very little guidance from the programmer basically guidance from the programmer basically guidance from the programmer basically deep learning mimics the way our brain deep learning mimics the way our brain deep learning mimics the way our brain functions that is it learns from functions that is it learns from functions that is it learns from experience so in deep learning what experience so in deep learning what experience so in deep learning what happens is feature extraction happens happens is feature extraction happens happens is feature extraction happens automatically you need very little automatically you need very little automatically you need very little guidance by the programmer so deep guidance by the programmer so deep guidance by the programmer so deep learning will learn the model and it'll learning will learn the model and it'll learning will learn the model and it'll understand which feature or which understand which feature or which understand which feature or which variable is important in predicting the variable is important in predicting the variable is important in predicting the outcome let's say you have millions of outcome let's say you have millions of outcome let's say you have millions of predictor variables for a particular predictor variables for a particular predictor variables for a particular problem statement how are you going to problem statement how are you going to problem statement how are you going to sit down and understand the significance sit down and understand the significance sit down and understand the significance of each of these predictor variables of each of these predictor variables of each of these predictor variables it's going to be almost impossible to it's going to be almost impossible to it's going to be almost impossible to sit down with so many features that's sit down with so many features that's sit down with so many features that's why we have deep learning whenever why we have deep learning whenever why we have deep learning whenever there's High dimensionality data or there's High dimensionality data or there's High dimensionality data or whenever the data is really large and it whenever the data is really large and it whenever the data is really large and it has a lot of features and a lot of has a lot of features and a lot of has a lot of features and a lot of predictor variables we use deep learning predictor variables we use deep learning predictor variables we use deep learning deep learning will extract features on deep learning will extract features on deep learning will extract features on its own and understand which features its own and understand which features its own and understand which features are important in predicting your output are important in predicting your output are important in predicting your output so that's the main idea behind deep so that's the main idea behind deep so that's the main idea behind deep learning let me give you a small example learning let me give you a small example learning let me give you a small example also suppose we want to make a system also suppose we want to make a system also suppose we want to make a system that can recognize the face of different that can recognize the face of different that can recognize the face of different people in an image okay so basically people in an image okay so basically people in an image okay so basically we're creating a system that can we're creating a system that can we're creating a system that can identify the faces of different people identify the faces of different people identify the faces of different people in an image if we solve this by using in an image if we solve this by using in an image if we solve this by using the typical machine learning algorithms the typical machine learning algorithms the typical machine learning algorithms we'll have to Define facial features we'll have to Define facial features we'll have to Define facial features like eyes nose ears Etc okay and then like eyes nose ears Etc okay and then like eyes nose ears Etc okay and then the system will identify which features the system will identify which features the system will identify which features are more important for which person now are more important for which person now are more important for which person now if you consider deep learning for the if you consider deep learning for the if you consider deep learning for the same example deep learning will same example deep learning will same example deep learning will automatically find out the features automatically find out the features automatically find out the features which are important for classification which are important for classification which are important for classification because it uses the concept of neural because it uses the concept of neural because it uses the concept of neural networks whereas in machine learning we networks whereas in machine learning we networks whereas in machine learning we have to manually Define these features have to manually Define these features have to manually Define these features on our own right that's the main on our own right that's the main on our own right that's the main difference between deep learning and difference between deep learning and difference between deep learning and machine learning now the next question machine learning now the next question machine learning now the next question is how does deep learning work now when is how does deep learning work now when is how does deep learning work now when people started coming up with deep people started coming up with deep people started coming up with deep learning their main aim was to learning their main aim was to learning their main aim was to re-engineer the human brain okay deep re-engineer the human brain okay deep re-engineer the human brain okay deep learning studies the basic unit of a learning studies the basic unit of a learning studies the basic unit of a brain called the brain cell or a neuron brain called the brain cell or a neuron brain called the brain cell or a neuron all of you biology students will know all of you biology students will know all of you biology students will know what I'm talking about so basically deep what I'm talking about so basically deep what I'm talking about so basically deep learning is inspired from our brain learning is inspired from our brain learning is inspired from our brain structure okay in our brains we have structure okay in our brains we have structure okay in our brains we have something known as neurons and these something known as neurons and these something known as neurons and these neurons are replicated in deep learning neurons are replicated in deep learning neurons are replicated in deep learning as artificial neurons which are also as artificial neurons which are also as artificial neurons which are also called perceptrons now before we called perceptrons now before we called perceptrons now before we understand how artificial neural understand how artificial neural understand how artificial neural networks or artificial neurons work networks or artificial neurons work networks or artificial neurons work let's understand how these biological let's understand how these biological let's understand how these biological neurons work because I'm not sure how neurons work because I'm not sure how neurons work because I'm not sure how many of you are bio students over here many of you are bio students over here many of you are bio students over here so let's uh understand the functionality so let's uh understand the functionality so let's uh understand the functionality of biological neurons and how we can of biological neurons and how we can of biological neurons and how we can mimic this functionality in a perceptron mimic this functionality in a perceptron mimic this functionality in a perceptron or in an artificial neuron so guys if or in an artificial neuron so guys if or in an artificial neuron so guys if you look at this image this is basically you look at this image this is basically you look at this image this is basically an image of a biological neuron if you an image of a biological neuron if you an image of a biological neuron if you focus on the structure of the biological focus on the structure of the biological focus on the structure of the biological neuron it has something known as DDS neuron it has something known as DDS neuron it has something known as DDS these dorids are basically used to these dorids are basically used to these dorids are basically used to receive inputs now the inputs are receive inputs now the inputs are receive inputs now the inputs are basically summed in the cell body and basically summed in the cell body and basically summed in the cell body and it's passed on to the next biological it's passed on to the next biological it's passed on to the next biological neuron so through ddes you're going to neuron so through ddes you're going to neuron so through ddes you're going to receive signals from other neurons receive signals from other neurons receive signals from other neurons basically input then the cell body will basically input then the cell body will basically input then the cell body will sum up all these inputs and the axon sum up all these inputs and the axon sum up all these inputs and the axon will transmit this input to other will transmit this input to other will transmit this input to other neurons the axon will fire up through neurons the axon will fire up through neurons the axon will fire up through some threshold and it will get passed on some threshold and it will get passed on some threshold and it will get passed on to the next neuron so similar to this a to the next neuron so similar to this a to the next neuron so similar to this a perceptron or an artificial neuron perceptron or an artificial neuron perceptron or an artificial neuron receives multiple inputs and applies receives multiple inputs and applies receives multiple inputs and applies various Transformations and functions various Transformations and functions various Transformations and functions and provides us an output these multiple and provides us an output these multiple and provides us an output these multiple inputs are nothing but your input inputs are nothing but your input inputs are nothing but your input variables or your predictor variables variables or your predictor variables variables or your predictor variables you're feeding input data to an you're feeding input data to an you're feeding input data to an artificial neuron or to a perceptron and artificial neuron or to a perceptron and artificial neuron or to a perceptron and this perceptron will apply various this perceptron will apply various this perceptron will apply various functions and Transformations and it functions and Transformations and it functions and Transformations and it will give you an output now just like will give you an output now just like will give you an output now just like our brain consists of multiple connected our brain consists of multiple connected our brain consists of multiple connected neurons called neural networks we also neurons called neural networks we also neurons called neural networks we also build something known as a network of build something known as a network of build something known as a network of artificial neurons called artificial artificial neurons called artificial artificial neurons called artificial neural networks so that's the basic neural networks so that's the basic neural networks so that's the basic concept behind deep learning to sum it concept behind deep learning to sum it concept behind deep learning to sum it up what exactly is deep learning now up what exactly is deep learning now up what exactly is deep learning now deep learning is a collection of deep learning is a collection of deep learning is a collection of statistical machine learning techniques statistical machine learning techniques statistical machine learning techniques used to learn feature hierarchies based used to learn feature hierarchies based used to learn feature hierarchies based on the concept of artificial neural on the concept of artificial neural on the concept of artificial neural networks so the main idea behind deep networks so the main idea behind deep networks so the main idea behind deep learning is artificial neural networks learning is artificial neural networks learning is artificial neural networks which work exactly like how our brain which work exactly like how our brain which work exactly like how our brain works now in this diagram you can see works now in this diagram you can see works now in this diagram you can see that there are a couple of layers and that there are a couple of layers and that there are a couple of layers and the first layer is known as the input the first layer is known as the input the first layer is known as the input layer this is where you receive all the layer this is where you receive all the layer this is where you receive all the inputs the last layer is known as the inputs the last layer is known as the inputs the last layer is known as the output layer which provides your desired output layer which provides your desired output layer which provides your desired output now all the layers which are output now all the layers which are output now all the layers which are there between your input layer and your there between your input layer and your there between your input layer and your output layer are known as the hidden output layer are known as the hidden output layer are known as the hidden layers now there can be n number of layers now there can be n number of layers now there can be n number of hidden layers uh thanks to all the hidden layers uh thanks to all the hidden layers uh thanks to all the resources that we have these days so you resources that we have these days so you resources that we have these days so you can have hundreds of hidden layers in can have hundreds of hidden layers in can have hundreds of hidden layers in between now the number of hidden layers between now the number of hidden layers between now the number of hidden layers and the number of perceptrons in each of and the number of perceptrons in each of and the number of perceptrons in each of these layers will entirely depend on the these layers will entirely depend on the these layers will entirely depend on the problem or on the use case that you're problem or on the use case that you're problem or on the use case that you're trying to solve so this is basically how trying to solve so this is basically how trying to solve so this is basically how deep learning works all right so let's deep learning works all right so let's deep learning works all right so let's look at the example that we saw earlier look at the example that we saw earlier look at the example that we saw earlier here what we want to do is we want to here what we want to do is we want to here what we want to do is we want to perform image recognition using deep perform image recognition using deep perform image recognition using deep networks first what we're going to do is networks first what we're going to do is networks first what we're going to do is we are going to pass this High we are going to pass this High we are going to pass this High dimensional data to the input layer to dimensional data to the input layer to dimensional data to the input layer to match the dimensionality of the input match the dimensionality of the input match the dimensionality of the input data the input layer will contain data the input layer will contain data the input layer will contain multiple sublayers of perceptrons so multiple sublayers of perceptrons so multiple sublayers of perceptrons so that it can consume the entire input that it can consume the entire input that it can consume the entire input okay so you'll have multiple sublayers okay so you'll have multiple sublayers okay so you'll have multiple sublayers of per Rons now the output received from of per Rons now the output received from of per Rons now the output received from the input layer will contain patterns the input layer will contain patterns the input layer will contain patterns and will only be able to identify the and will only be able to identify the and will only be able to identify the edges of the images based on the edges of the images based on the edges of the images based on the contrast levels this output will then be contrast levels this output will then be contrast levels this output will then be fed to Hidden layer number one where fed to Hidden layer number one where fed to Hidden layer number one where it'll be able to identify facial it'll be able to identify facial it'll be able to identify facial features like your eyes nose ears and features like your eyes nose ears and features like your eyes nose ears and all of that now from here the output all of that now from here the output all of that now from here the output will be fed to Hidden layer number two will be fed to Hidden layer number two will be fed to Hidden layer number two where it'll be able to form entire faces where it'll be able to form entire faces where it'll be able to form entire faces right it'll go deeper into face right it'll go deeper into face right it'll go deeper into face recognition and this output of the recognition and this output of the recognition and this output of the Hidden layer will be sent to the output Hidden layer will be sent to the output Hidden layer will be sent to the output layer or any other hidden layer that is layer or any other hidden layer that is layer or any other hidden layer that is there before the output layer now there before the output layer now there before the output layer now finally the output layer will perform finally the output layer will perform finally the output layer will perform classification based on the result that classification based on the result that classification based on the result that you get from your previous layers so you get from your previous layers so you get from your previous layers so this is exactly how deep learning works this is exactly how deep learning works this is exactly how deep learning works this is a small analogy that I used to this is a small analogy that I used to this is a small analogy that I used to make you understand what deep learning make you understand what deep learning make you understand what deep learning is now let's understand what a single is now let's understand what a single is now let's understand what a single layer perceptron is so like I said layer perceptron is so like I said layer perceptron is so like I said perceptron is basically an artificial perceptron is basically an artificial perceptron is basically an artificial neuron there's something known as single neuron there's something known as single neuron there's something known as single layer layer and multiple layer layer layer and multiple layer layer layer and multiple layer perceptron we'll first focus on single perceptron we'll first focus on single perceptron we'll first focus on single layer perceptron now before I explain layer perceptron now before I explain layer perceptron now before I explain what a perceptron really is you should what a perceptron really is you should what a perceptron really is you should know that perceptrons are linear know that perceptrons are linear know that perceptrons are linear classifiers right a single layer classifiers right a single layer classifiers right a single layer perceptron is a linear or a binary perceptron is a linear or a binary perceptron is a linear or a binary classifier it is used mainly in classifier it is used mainly in classifier it is used mainly in supervised learning and it helps to supervised learning and it helps to supervised learning and it helps to classify the given input data into classify the given input data into classify the given input data into separate classes so this diagram separate classes so this diagram separate classes so this diagram basically represents a perceptron all basically represents a perceptron all basically represents a perceptron all right a perceptron has multiple inputs right a perceptron has multiple inputs right a perceptron has multiple inputs right it has a set of inputs labeled X1 right it has a set of inputs labeled X1 right it has a set of inputs labeled X1 X2 until xn now each of these input is X2 until xn now each of these input is X2 until xn now each of these input is given a specific weight okay so W1 given a specific weight okay so W1 given a specific weight okay so W1 represents the weight of input X1 W2 represents the weight of input X1 W2 represents the weight of input X1 W2 represents the weight of input X2 and so represents the weight of input X2 and so represents the weight of input X2 and so on now how you assign these weights is a on now how you assign these weights is a on now how you assign these weights is a different thing alog together but for different thing alog together but for different thing alog together but for now you need to know that each input is now you need to know that each input is now you need to know that each input is assigned a particular weightage now what assigned a particular weightage now what assigned a particular weightage now what the perceptron does is it computes some the perceptron does is it computes some the perceptron does is it computes some function on these weighted inputs and function on these weighted inputs and function on these weighted inputs and it'll give you the output so basically it'll give you the output so basically it'll give you the output so basically these weighted inputs go through these weighted inputs go through these weighted inputs go through something known as summation okay something known as summation okay something known as summation okay summation is nothing but the product of summation is nothing but the product of summation is nothing but the product of each of your input with its respective each of your input with its respective each of your input with its respective weight now after the summation is done weight now after the summation is done weight now after the summation is done this is passed on to a transfer function this is passed on to a transfer function this is passed on to a transfer function a transfer function is nothing but an a transfer function is nothing but an a transfer function is nothing but an activation function I'll be discussing activation function I'll be discussing activation function I'll be discussing more about this in a minute right the more about this in a minute right the more about this in a minute right the activation function and from the activation function and from the activation function and from the activation function you'll get the activation function you'll get the activation function you'll get the outputs y1 Y2 and so on so guys you need outputs y1 Y2 and so on so guys you need outputs y1 Y2 and so on so guys you need to understand four important parts Parts to understand four important parts Parts to understand four important parts Parts in a perceptron so firstly you have the in a perceptron so firstly you have the in a perceptron so firstly you have the input values right you have X1 X2 X3 you input values right you have X1 X2 X3 you input values right you have X1 X2 X3 you have something known as weights and bias have something known as weights and bias have something known as weights and bias and then you have something known as the and then you have something known as the and then you have something known as the net sum and finally the activation net sum and finally the activation net sum and finally the activation function now all the inputs X are function now all the inputs X are function now all the inputs X are multiplied with a respective wids so X1 multiplied with a respective wids so X1 multiplied with a respective wids so X1 will be multiplied with W1 all right will be multiplied with W1 all right will be multiplied with W1 all right this is known as the summation now after this is known as the summation now after this is known as the summation now after this you'll add all the multiplied this you'll add all the multiplied this you'll add all the multiplied values and you'll call them as the values and you'll call them as the values and you'll call them as the weighted sum all right this is done weighted sum all right this is done weighted sum all right this is done using the summation function now you'll using the summation function now you'll using the summation function now you'll apply the weighted sum to a correct apply the weighted sum to a correct apply the weighted sum to a correct activation function now a lot of people activation function now a lot of people activation function now a lot of people have a confusion about activation have a confusion about activation have a confusion about activation function activation function is also function activation function is also function activation function is also known as the transfer function now in known as the transfer function now in known as the transfer function now in order to understand activation function order to understand activation function order to understand activation function this word uh stems from the way neurons this word uh stems from the way neurons this word uh stems from the way neurons in a human brain work the neuron becomes in a human brain work the neuron becomes in a human brain work the neuron becomes active only after a certain potential is active only after a certain potential is active only after a certain potential is reached now that threshold is known as reached now that threshold is known as reached now that threshold is known as the activation potential therefore the activation potential therefore the activation potential therefore mathematically it can be represented by mathematically it can be represented by mathematically it can be represented by a function that reaches saturation after a function that reaches saturation after a function that reaches saturation after a threshold okay we have a lot of a threshold okay we have a lot of a threshold okay we have a lot of activation functions like Signum sigmoid activation functions like Signum sigmoid activation functions like Signum sigmoid tan hedge and so on okay you can think tan hedge and so on okay you can think tan hedge and so on okay you can think of activation function as a function of activation function as a function of activation function as a function that Maps the input to the respective that Maps the input to the respective that Maps the input to the respective output now I also spoke about weights output now I also spoke about weights output now I also spoke about weights and bias now why do we assign weights to and bias now why do we assign weights to and bias now why do we assign weights to each of these inputs what weights do is each of these inputs what weights do is each of these inputs what weights do is they show the strength of a particular they show the strength of a particular they show the strength of a particular input or how important a particular input or how important a particular input or how important a particular input is for predicting the fin final input is for predicting the fin final input is for predicting the fin final output so basically the weightage of an output so basically the weightage of an output so basically the weightage of an input denotes the importance of that input denotes the importance of that input denotes the importance of that input now a bias basically allows us to input now a bias basically allows us to input now a bias basically allows us to shift the activation function in order shift the activation function in order shift the activation function in order to get a precise output so that was all to get a precise output so that was all to get a precise output so that was all about perceptrons now in order to make about perceptrons now in order to make about perceptrons now in order to make you understand perceptrons better let's you understand perceptrons better let's you understand perceptrons better let's look at a small look at a small look at a small analogy suppose that you want to go to a analogy suppose that you want to go to a analogy suppose that you want to go to a party happening near your house now your party happening near your house now your party happening near your house now your decision will depend on a set of factors decision will depend on a set of factors decision will depend on a set of factors first is how is the weather second is first is how is the weather second is first is how is the weather second is probably is your wife or your girlfriend probably is your wife or your girlfriend probably is your wife or your girlfriend or your boyfriend going with you and or your boyfriend going with you and or your boyfriend going with you and third is is there any public transport third is is there any public transport third is is there any public transport available all right let's say these are available all right let's say these are available all right let's say these are the three factors that you're going to the three factors that you're going to the three factors that you're going to consider before you go to a party so consider before you go to a party so consider before you go to a party so depending on these predictor variables depending on these predictor variables depending on these predictor variables or these features you're going to decide or these features you're going to decide or these features you're going to decide whether you're going to stay at home or whether you're going to stay at home or whether you're going to stay at home or go and party now how is the weather is go and party now how is the weather is go and party now how is the weather is going to be your first input right we'll going to be your first input right we'll going to be your first input right we'll represent this with a value X1 is your represent this with a value X1 is your represent this with a value X1 is your wife going with you is another input X2 wife going with you is another input X2 wife going with you is another input X2 any public transport is available is any public transport is available is any public transport is available is your another input X3 now X1 will have your another input X3 now X1 will have your another input X3 now X1 will have two values 1 and zero one represents two values 1 and zero one represents two values 1 and zero one represents that the weather is good zero represents that the weather is good zero represents that the weather is good zero represents weather is bad similarly one represents weather is bad similarly one represents weather is bad similarly one represents that your wife is going and zero that your wife is going and zero that your wife is going and zero represents that your wife is not going represents that your wife is not going represents that your wife is not going and in X3 again one represents that and in X3 again one represents that and in X3 again one represents that there is public transport and zero there is public transport and zero there is public transport and zero represents that there is no public represents that there is no public represents that there is no public transport now your output will either be transport now your output will either be transport now your output will either be one or zero one means you are going to one or zero one means you are going to one or zero one means you are going to the the party and zero means you'll be the the party and zero means you'll be the the party and zero means you'll be sitting at home now in order to sitting at home now in order to sitting at home now in order to understand weightage let's say that the understand weightage let's say that the understand weightage let's say that the most important factor for you is your most important factor for you is your most important factor for you is your weather if the weather is good it means weather if the weather is good it means weather if the weather is good it means that you will 100% go to the party now that you will 100% go to the party now that you will 100% go to the party now if your weather is not good you've if your weather is not good you've if your weather is not good you've decided that you'll sit at home so the decided that you'll sit at home so the decided that you'll sit at home so the maximum weightage is for your weather maximum weightage is for your weather maximum weightage is for your weather variable so if your weather is really variable so if your weather is really variable so if your weather is really good you will go to the party it is a good you will go to the party it is a good you will go to the party it is a very important factor in order to very important factor in order to very important factor in order to understand whether you're going to sit understand whether you're going to sit understand whether you're going to sit at home or you're going to go to the the at home or you're going to go to the the at home or you're going to go to the the party so basically if X1 equal to 1 your party so basically if X1 equal to 1 your party so basically if X1 equal to 1 your output will be 1 meaning that if your output will be 1 meaning that if your output will be 1 meaning that if your weather is good you'll go to the party weather is good you'll go to the party weather is good you'll go to the party now let's randomly assign weights to now let's randomly assign weights to now let's randomly assign weights to each of our input W1 is the weight each of our input W1 is the weight each of our input W1 is the weight associated with input X1 W2 is the associated with input X1 W2 is the associated with input X1 W2 is the weight with X2 and W3 is the weight weight with X2 and W3 is the weight weight with X2 and W3 is the weight associated with X3 let's say that your associated with X3 let's say that your associated with X3 let's say that your W1 is 6 your W2 is 2 and W3 is 2 Now by W1 is 6 your W2 is 2 and W3 is 2 Now by W1 is 6 your W2 is 2 and W3 is 2 Now by using the activation function you're using the activation function you're using the activation function you're going to set a threshold of five going to set a threshold of five going to set a threshold of five now this means that it will fire when now this means that it will fire when now this means that it will fire when the weather is good and won't fire if the weather is good and won't fire if the weather is good and won't fire if the weather is bad irrespective of the the weather is bad irrespective of the the weather is bad irrespective of the other inputs now here because your other inputs now here because your other inputs now here because your weightage is six so basically if you weightage is six so basically if you weightage is six so basically if you consider your first input which has a consider your first input which has a consider your first input which has a weightage of six that means you're 100% weightage of six that means you're 100% weightage of six that means you're 100% going to go let's say we considering going to go let's say we considering going to go let's say we considering only the second input this means that only the second input this means that only the second input this means that you're not going to go because your you're not going to go because your you're not going to go because your weightage is two and your threshold is weightage is two and your threshold is weightage is two and your threshold is five so if your weightage is below your five so if your weightage is below your five so if your weightage is below your threshold it means that you're not going threshold it means that you're not going threshold it means that you're not going to go now let's consider another to go now let's consider another to go now let's consider another scenario where a threshold is three this scenario where a threshold is three this scenario where a threshold is three this means that it'll fire when either X1 is means that it'll fire when either X1 is means that it'll fire when either X1 is high or the other two inputs are high high or the other two inputs are high high or the other two inputs are high now W2 is associated with your wife is now W2 is associated with your wife is now W2 is associated with your wife is going or not let's say the weather is going or not let's say the weather is going or not let's say the weather is bad and you have no public bad and you have no public bad and you have no public transportation meaning that your X1 and transportation meaning that your X1 and transportation meaning that your X1 and X3 is zero and only your X2 is 1 now if X3 is zero and only your X2 is 1 now if X3 is zero and only your X2 is 1 now if your X2 is 1 your weightage is going to your X2 is 1 your weightage is going to your X2 is 1 your weightage is going to be two if your weightage is two you will be two if your weightage is two you will be two if your weightage is two you will not go because the threshold value is not go because the threshold value is not go because the threshold value is set to three the threshold value is set set to three the threshold value is set set to three the threshold value is set in such a way that if X2 and X3 are in such a way that if X2 and X3 are in such a way that if X2 and X3 are combined together only then you'll go or combined together only then you'll go or combined together only then you'll go or only if X1 is true then you'll go so only if X1 is true then you'll go so only if X1 is true then you'll go so you're assigning threshold in such a way you're assigning threshold in such a way you're assigning threshold in such a way that you will go for sure if the weather that you will go for sure if the weather that you will go for sure if the weather is good right this is how you assign is good right this is how you assign is good right this is how you assign threshold this is nothing but your threshold this is nothing but your threshold this is nothing but your activation function so guys I hope all activation function so guys I hope all activation function so guys I hope all of you understood the most amount of of you understood the most amount of of you understood the most amount of weightage is associated with the input weightage is associated with the input weightage is associated with the input that is very important in predic ing that is very important in predic ing that is very important in predic ing your output this is exactly how a your output this is exactly how a your output this is exactly how a perceptron works now let's look at the perceptron works now let's look at the perceptron works now let's look at the limitations of a perceptron now in a limitations of a perceptron now in a limitations of a perceptron now in a perceptron there are no hidden layers perceptron there are no hidden layers perceptron there are no hidden layers right there's only a input layer and right there's only a input layer and right there's only a input layer and there is an output layer we have no there is an output layer we have no there is an output layer we have no hidden layers in between and because of hidden layers in between and because of hidden layers in between and because of this you cannot classify nonlinearly this you cannot classify nonlinearly this you cannot classify nonlinearly separable data points okay if you have separable data points okay if you have separable data points okay if you have data like in this figure how would you data like in this figure how would you data like in this figure how would you separate this you cannot use a separate this you cannot use a separate this you cannot use a perceptron to do this all right so perceptron to do this all right so perceptron to do this all right so complex problems that involve a lot of complex problems that involve a lot of complex problems that involve a lot of parameters cannot be solved by a single parameters cannot be solved by a single parameters cannot be solved by a single layer perceptron that's why we need layer perceptron that's why we need layer perceptron that's why we need something known as multiple layer something known as multiple layer something known as multiple layer perceptron so now we'll discuss perceptron so now we'll discuss perceptron so now we'll discuss something known as multi-layer something known as multi-layer something known as multi-layer perceptron a multi-layer perceptron has perceptron a multi-layer perceptron has perceptron a multi-layer perceptron has the same structure of a single layer the same structure of a single layer the same structure of a single layer perceptron but with one or more hidden perceptron but with one or more hidden perceptron but with one or more hidden layers okay and that's why it's layers okay and that's why it's layers okay and that's why it's considered as a deep neural network so considered as a deep neural network so considered as a deep neural network so in a single layer perceptron we had only in a single layer perceptron we had only in a single layer perceptron we had only a input layer output layer right we a input layer output layer right we a input layer output layer right we didn't have any hidden layer now when it didn't have any hidden layer now when it didn't have any hidden layer now when it comes to multi-layer perceptrons there comes to multi-layer perceptrons there comes to multi-layer perceptrons there are hidden layers in between and then are hidden layers in between and then are hidden layers in between and then there is the output layer it works in there is the output layer it works in there is the output layer it works in the similar manner like I said first the similar manner like I said first the similar manner like I said first you'll have the inputs X1 X2 X3 and so you'll have the inputs X1 X2 X3 and so you'll have the inputs X1 X2 X3 and so on and each of these inputs will be on and each of these inputs will be on and each of these inputs will be assigned some weight right W1 W2 W3 and assigned some weight right W1 W2 W3 and assigned some weight right W1 W2 W3 and so on then you'll calculate the weighted so on then you'll calculate the weighted so on then you'll calculate the weighted summation of each of these inputs and summation of each of these inputs and summation of each of these inputs and their weights after that you'll send their weights after that you'll send their weights after that you'll send them to the transformation or the them to the transformation or the them to the transformation or the activation function and you'll finally activation function and you'll finally activation function and you'll finally get the output now the only thing uh is get the output now the only thing uh is get the output now the only thing uh is that you'll have multiple hidden layers that you'll have multiple hidden layers that you'll have multiple hidden layers in between one or more than one hidden in between one or more than one hidden in between one or more than one hidden layers so guys this is how a multi-layer layers so guys this is how a multi-layer layers so guys this is how a multi-layer perceptron works it works on the concept perceptron works it works on the concept perceptron works it works on the concept of feed forward neural networks feed of feed forward neural networks feed of feed forward neural networks feed forward means every node at each level forward means every node at each level forward means every node at each level or each layer is connected to every or each layer is connected to every or each layer is connected to every other node so that's what feed forward other node so that's what feed forward other node so that's what feed forward networks are now when it comes to networks are now when it comes to networks are now when it comes to assigning weights what we do is we assigning weights what we do is we assigning weights what we do is we randomly assign weights right initially randomly assign weights right initially randomly assign weights right initially we have input X1 X2 X3 we randomly ass we have input X1 X2 X3 we randomly ass we have input X1 X2 X3 we randomly ass assign some weight W1 W2 W3 and so on assign some weight W1 W2 W3 and so on assign some weight W1 W2 W3 and so on now it's always necessary that whatever now it's always necessary that whatever now it's always necessary that whatever weights we assign to our input those weights we assign to our input those weights we assign to our input those weights are actually correct meaning weights are actually correct meaning weights are actually correct meaning that those weights are actually that those weights are actually that those weights are actually significant in predicting your output so significant in predicting your output so significant in predicting your output so how a multi-layer perceptron works is a how a multi-layer perceptron works is a how a multi-layer perceptron works is a set of inputs are passed to the first set of inputs are passed to the first set of inputs are passed to the first hidden layer now the activations from hidden layer now the activations from hidden layer now the activations from that layer are passed to the next layer that layer are passed to the next layer that layer are passed to the next layer and from that layer it's passed to the and from that layer it's passed to the and from that layer it's passed to the next hidden layer until you reach the next hidden layer until you reach the next hidden layer until you reach the output layer right from the output layer output layer right from the output layer output layer right from the output layer you'll form the two classes class one you'll form the two classes class one you'll form the two classes class one and class two basically you'll classify and class two basically you'll classify and class two basically you'll classify your input into one of the two classes your input into one of the two classes your input into one of the two classes so that's how a multi-layer perceptron so that's how a multi-layer perceptron so that's how a multi-layer perceptron Works a very important Concept in Works a very important Concept in Works a very important Concept in multiple layer perceptron is back multiple layer perceptron is back multiple layer perceptron is back propagation now what is back propagation propagation now what is back propagation propagation now what is back propagation back propagation algorithm is a back propagation algorithm is a back propagation algorithm is a supervised learning method for supervised learning method for supervised learning method for multi-layer perceptrons okay now why do multi-layer perceptrons okay now why do multi-layer perceptrons okay now why do we need back propagation so guys when we we need back propagation so guys when we we need back propagation so guys when we are designing a neural network in the are designing a neural network in the are designing a neural network in the beginning we initialize weights with beginning we initialize weights with beginning we initialize weights with some random values or any variable for some random values or any variable for some random values or any variable for that fact now obviously we need to make that fact now obviously we need to make that fact now obviously we need to make sure that these weights actually are sure that these weights actually are sure that these weights actually are correct meaning that these weights show correct meaning that these weights show correct meaning that these weights show the significance of each predictor the significance of each predictor the significance of each predictor variable these weights have to fit our variable these weights have to fit our variable these weights have to fit our model in such a way that our output is model in such a way that our output is model in such a way that our output is very precise so let's say that we very precise so let's say that we very precise so let's say that we randomly selected some weights in the randomly selected some weights in the randomly selected some weights in the beginning but our model output is much beginning but our model output is much beginning but our model output is much more different than our actual output more different than our actual output more different than our actual output meaning that our eror error value is meaning that our eror error value is meaning that our eror error value is very huge so how will you reduce this very huge so how will you reduce this very huge so how will you reduce this error basically what you need to do is error basically what you need to do is error basically what you need to do is we need to somehow explain to the model we need to somehow explain to the model we need to somehow explain to the model that we need to change the weights in that we need to change the weights in that we need to change the weights in such a way that the error becomes such a way that the error becomes such a way that the error becomes minimum so the main thing is the weights minimum so the main thing is the weights minimum so the main thing is the weights and your error is very highly related and your error is very highly related and your error is very highly related the weightage that you give to each the weightage that you give to each the weightage that you give to each input will show how much error is there input will show how much error is there input will show how much error is there in your output because the most in your output because the most in your output because the most significant variables will have the significant variables will have the significant variables will have the highest weightage and if the weightage highest weightage and if the weightage highest weightage and if the weightage is not correct then your output is also is not correct then your output is also is not correct then your output is also not correct now back propagation is a not correct now back propagation is a not correct now back propagation is a way to update your weights in such a way way to update your weights in such a way way to update your weights in such a way that your outcome is precise and your that your outcome is precise and your that your outcome is precise and your error is reduced so in short back error is reduced so in short back error is reduced so in short back propagation is used to train a propagation is used to train a propagation is used to train a multi-layer perceptron it's basically multi-layer perceptron it's basically multi-layer perceptron it's basically used to update your weights in such a used to update your weights in such a used to update your weights in such a way that your output is more precise and way that your output is more precise and way that your output is more precise and that your error is reduced so training a that your error is reduced so training a that your error is reduced so training a neural network is all about back neural network is all about back neural network is all about back propagation so the most common deep propagation so the most common deep propagation so the most common deep learning algorithm for supervised train learning algorithm for supervised train learning algorithm for supervised train of the multi-layer perceptron is known of the multi-layer perceptron is known of the multi-layer perceptron is known as back propagation so after calculating as back propagation so after calculating as back propagation so after calculating the weighted sum of inputs and passing the weighted sum of inputs and passing the weighted sum of inputs and passing them through the activation function we them through the activation function we them through the activation function we propagate backwards and update the propagate backwards and update the propagate backwards and update the weight to reduce the error it's as weight to reduce the error it's as weight to reduce the error it's as simple as that so in the beginning simple as that so in the beginning simple as that so in the beginning you're going to assign some weights to you're going to assign some weights to you're going to assign some weights to each of your input now these inputs will each of your input now these inputs will each of your input now these inputs will go through the activation function and go through the activation function and go through the activation function and it'll go through all the hidden layers it'll go through all the hidden layers it'll go through all the hidden layers and give us an output now when you get and give us an output now when you get and give us an output now when you get the output the output is not very the output the output is not very the output the output is not very precise size or it is not the desired precise size or it is not the desired precise size or it is not the desired output so what you do is you propagate output so what you do is you propagate output so what you do is you propagate backwards and you start updating your backwards and you start updating your backwards and you start updating your weights in such a way that your error is weights in such a way that your error is weights in such a way that your error is as minimum as possible so I'm going to as minimum as possible so I'm going to as minimum as possible so I'm going to repeat this once more so the idea behind repeat this once more so the idea behind repeat this once more so the idea behind back propagation is to choose weights in back propagation is to choose weights in back propagation is to choose weights in such a way that your error gets such a way that your error gets such a way that your error gets minimized to understand this we'll look minimized to understand this we'll look minimized to understand this we'll look at a small example let's say that we at a small example let's say that we at a small example let's say that we have a data set which has these labels have a data set which has these labels have a data set which has these labels okay your input is 0 1 2 but your okay your input is 0 1 2 but your okay your input is 0 1 2 but your desired out output is 0 1 and 4 now the desired out output is 0 1 and 4 now the desired out output is 0 1 and 4 now the output of your model when w = to 3 is output of your model when w = to 3 is output of your model when w = to 3 is like this notice the difference between like this notice the difference between like this notice the difference between your model output and your desired your model output and your desired your model output and your desired output so your model output is three but output so your model output is three but output so your model output is three but your desired output is two okay your desired output is two okay your desired output is two okay similarly when your model output is six similarly when your model output is six similarly when your model output is six your desired output is supposed to be your desired output is supposed to be your desired output is supposed to be four now let's calculate the error when four now let's calculate the error when four now let's calculate the error when weight is equal to three the error is weight is equal to three the error is weight is equal to three the error is zero over here because your desired zero over here because your desired zero over here because your desired output is zero and your model output is output is zero and your model output is output is zero and your model output is also zero now the error in the second also zero now the error in the second also zero now the error in the second case is one basically your model output case is one basically your model output case is one basically your model output minus your desired output 3 - 2 your minus your desired output 3 - 2 your minus your desired output 3 - 2 your error is 1 similarly your error for the error is 1 similarly your error for the error is 1 similarly your error for the third input is 2 which is 6 - 4 when you third input is 2 which is 6 - 4 when you third input is 2 which is 6 - 4 when you take the square this is actually a very take the square this is actually a very take the square this is actually a very huge difference right your error becomes huge difference right your error becomes huge difference right your error becomes larger now what we need to do is we need larger now what we need to do is we need larger now what we need to do is we need to update the weight value in such a way to update the weight value in such a way to update the weight value in such a way that our error decreases now here we've that our error decreases now here we've that our error decreases now here we've considered the weight as four so when considered the weight as four so when considered the weight as four so when you consider the weight as 4 your model you consider the weight as 4 your model you consider the weight as 4 your model output becomes 0 4 and 8 your desired output becomes 0 4 and 8 your desired output becomes 0 4 and 8 your desired output is 0 2 and four so your model output is 0 2 and four so your model output is 0 2 and four so your model output becomes 0 4 and 8 which is a lot output becomes 0 4 and 8 which is a lot output becomes 0 4 and 8 which is a lot so guys I hope you all know how to so guys I hope you all know how to so guys I hope you all know how to calculate the output over here what I'm calculate the output over here what I'm calculate the output over here what I'm doing is I'm multiplying the input with doing is I'm multiplying the input with doing is I'm multiplying the input with your weightage the weightage is four so your weightage the weightage is four so your weightage the weightage is four so 0 into 4 will give me 0er 1 into 4 will 0 into 4 will give me 0er 1 into 4 will 0 into 4 will give me 0er 1 into 4 will give me 4 and 2 into 4 will give me 8 give me 4 and 2 into 4 will give me 8 give me 4 and 2 into 4 will give me 8 right that's how I'm getting my model right that's how I'm getting my model right that's how I'm getting my model output over here for now this is how I'm output over here for now this is how I'm output over here for now this is how I'm getting the output over here that's how getting the output over here that's how getting the output over here that's how you calculate your weightage now here if you calculate your weightage now here if you calculate your weightage now here if you see that our desired output is you see that our desired output is you see that our desired output is supposed to be 0 2 and 4 but we're supposed to be 0 2 and 4 but we're supposed to be 0 2 and 4 but we're getting an output of 0 4 and 8 so our getting an output of 0 4 and 8 so our getting an output of 0 4 and 8 so our error is actually increasing as we error is actually increasing as we error is actually increasing as we increase our weight our error for w increase our weight our error for w increase our weight our error for w equal 4 has become 0 4 and 16 whereas equal 4 has become 0 4 and 16 whereas equal 4 has become 0 4 and 16 whereas the error for wal 3 was 0 1 and 4 I mean the error for wal 3 was 0 1 and 4 I mean the error for wal 3 was 0 1 and 4 I mean the square error so if you look at this the square error so if you look at this the square error so if you look at this as as we increase our weightage our as as we increase our weightage our as as we increase our weightage our error is increasing so obviously we know error is increasing so obviously we know error is increasing so obviously we know that there is no point in increasing the that there is no point in increasing the that there is no point in increasing the value of w further but if we decrease value of w further but if we decrease value of w further but if we decrease the value of w our error actually the value of w our error actually the value of w our error actually decreases right if we give a weightage decreases right if we give a weightage decreases right if we give a weightage of two our error decreases so if we can of two our error decreases so if we can of two our error decreases so if we can find a relationship between our weight find a relationship between our weight find a relationship between our weight and error basically if you increase the and error basically if you increase the and error basically if you increase the weight your error also increases if you weight your error also increases if you weight your error also increases if you decrease the weight your error also decrease the weight your error also decrease the weight your error also decreases now what we did here is we decreases now what we did here is we decreases now what we did here is we first in initialize some random value to first in initialize some random value to first in initialize some random value to W and then we propagate it forward then W and then we propagate it forward then W and then we propagate it forward then we notice that there is some error and we notice that there is some error and we notice that there is some error and to reduce that error we propagate it to reduce that error we propagate it to reduce that error we propagate it backwards and increase the value of w backwards and increase the value of w backwards and increase the value of w after that we notice that the error has after that we notice that the error has after that we notice that the error has increased and we came to know that we increased and we came to know that we increased and we came to know that we can't increase the W value obviously if can't increase the W value obviously if can't increase the W value obviously if your error is increasing with increasing your error is increasing with increasing your error is increasing with increasing your weight you will not increase the your weight you will not increase the your weight you will not increase the weight so again we propagated backwards weight so again we propagated backwards weight so again we propagated backwards and we decreased the W value so after and we decreased the W value so after and we decreased the W value so after that we noticed that the error has that we noticed that the error has that we noticed that the error has reduced so what we're trying is we're reduced so what we're trying is we're reduced so what we're trying is we're trying to get the value of weight in trying to get the value of weight in trying to get the value of weight in such a way that the error becomes as such a way that the error becomes as such a way that the error becomes as minimum as possible so we need to figure minimum as possible so we need to figure minimum as possible so we need to figure out whether we need to increase or out whether we need to increase or out whether we need to increase or decrease the weight value once we know decrease the weight value once we know decrease the weight value once we know that we keep on updating the weight that we keep on updating the weight that we keep on updating the weight value in that direction until the error value in that direction until the error value in that direction until the error becomes minimum now you might reach a becomes minimum now you might reach a becomes minimum now you might reach a point where if you further update the point where if you further update the point where if you further update the weight the error will again increase at weight the error will again increase at weight the error will again increase at that point you need to stop okay that that point you need to stop okay that that point you need to stop okay that point is where your final weight value point is where your final weight value point is where your final weight value is there so basically this graph denotes is there so basically this graph denotes is there so basically this graph denotes that point now this point is nothing but that point now this point is nothing but that point now this point is nothing but the global loss minimum if you update the global loss minimum if you update the global loss minimum if you update the weights further yours error will the weights further yours error will the weights further yours error will also increase now you need to find out also increase now you need to find out also increase now you need to find out where your Global loss minimum is and where your Global loss minimum is and where your Global loss minimum is and that is where your Optimum weight lies that is where your Optimum weight lies that is where your Optimum weight lies so let me summarize the steps for you so let me summarize the steps for you so let me summarize the steps for you first you'll calculate the error okay first you'll calculate the error okay first you'll calculate the error okay this is how far your model output is this is how far your model output is this is how far your model output is from your actual output then you'll from your actual output then you'll from your actual output then you'll check whether the error is minimized or check whether the error is minimized or check whether the error is minimized or not after that if the error is very huge not after that if the error is very huge not after that if the error is very huge then you'll update the weight and you'll then you'll update the weight and you'll then you'll update the weight and you'll check the error again right you'll check the error again right you'll check the error again right you'll repeat the process until the error repeat the process until the error repeat the process until the error becomes minimum now once you reach the becomes minimum now once you reach the becomes minimum now once you reach the global loss minimum you'll stop updating global loss minimum you'll stop updating global loss minimum you'll stop updating the weights and you will finalize your the weights and you will finalize your the weights and you will finalize your weight value this is exactly how back weight value this is exactly how back weight value this is exactly how back propagation works now in order to tell propagation works now in order to tell propagation works now in order to tell you mathematically what we're doing is you mathematically what we're doing is you mathematically what we're doing is we're using a method known as gradient we're using a method known as gradient we're using a method known as gradient descent okay this method is used to descent okay this method is used to descent okay this method is used to adjust all the weights in the network adjust all the weights in the network adjust all the weights in the network with an aim of reducing the error at the with an aim of reducing the error at the with an aim of reducing the error at the output layer so how gradient descent output layer so how gradient descent output layer so how gradient descent Optimizer works is the first step is you Optimizer works is the first step is you Optimizer works is the first step is you will calculate the error by considering will calculate the error by considering will calculate the error by considering the below equation here you're the below equation here you're the below equation here you're subtracting the summation of your actual subtracting the summation of your actual subtracting the summation of your actual output from your network output step two output from your network output step two output from your network output step two is based on the error you get you will is based on the error you get you will is based on the error you get you will calculate the rate of change of error calculate the rate of change of error calculate the rate of change of error with respect to the change in the weight with respect to the change in the weight with respect to the change in the weight the learning rate is something that you the learning rate is something that you the learning rate is something that you set in the beginning itself step three set in the beginning itself step three set in the beginning itself step three is based on this change in weight you is based on this change in weight you is based on this change in weight you will calculate the new weight all right will calculate the new weight all right will calculate the new weight all right your updated weight will be your weight your updated weight will be your weight your updated weight will be your weight plus the rate of change of weight so plus the rate of change of weight so plus the rate of change of weight so guys that was all about back propagation guys that was all about back propagation guys that was all about back propagation and weight update now let's look at the and weight update now let's look at the and weight update now let's look at the limitations of feed forward Network so limitations of feed forward Network so limitations of feed forward Network so far we were discussing the multiple uh far we were discussing the multiple uh far we were discussing the multiple uh layer perceptron which uses the feed layer perceptron which uses the feed layer perceptron which uses the feed forward Network now let's discuss the forward Network now let's discuss the forward Network now let's discuss the limitations of these feedforward limitations of these feedforward limitations of these feedforward networks now let's consider an example networks now let's consider an example networks now let's consider an example of image classification okay let's say of image classification okay let's say of image classification okay let's say you've trained the neural network to you've trained the neural network to you've trained the neural network to classify images of various animals now classify images of various animals now classify images of various animals now let's consider an example here the first let's consider an example here the first let's consider an example here the first output is an elephant right we have an output is an elephant right we have an output is an elephant right we have an elephant and this output will have elephant and this output will have elephant and this output will have nothing to do with the previous output nothing to do with the previous output nothing to do with the previous output which is a dog this means that the which is a dog this means that the which is a dog this means that the output at time T is independent of the output at time T is independent of the output at time T is independent of the output at time T minus one now consider output at time T minus one now consider output at time T minus one now consider the scenario where you will require the the scenario where you will require the the scenario where you will require the use of previously obtained output okay use of previously obtained output okay use of previously obtained output okay the concept is very similar to reading a the concept is very similar to reading a the concept is very similar to reading a book as you turn every page you need an book as you turn every page you need an book as you turn every page you need an understanding of the previous Pages if understanding of the previous Pages if understanding of the previous Pages if you want to make sense of the you want to make sense of the you want to make sense of the information then you need to know what information then you need to know what information then you need to know what you learned before it's exactly what you learned before it's exactly what you learned before it's exactly what you're doing right now in order to you're doing right now in order to you're doing right now in order to understand deep learning you had to understand deep learning you had to understand deep learning you had to understand machine learning so basically understand machine learning so basically understand machine learning so basically with a feed forward Network the new with a feed forward Network the new with a feed forward Network the new output at time t+1 has nothing to do output at time t+1 has nothing to do output at time t+1 has nothing to do with the output at time t or T minus one with the output at time t or T minus one with the output at time t or T minus one or tus2 so feed for networks cannot be or tus2 so feed for networks cannot be or tus2 so feed for networks cannot be used while predicting a word in a used while predicting a word in a used while predicting a word in a sentence as it will have absolutely no sentence as it will have absolutely no sentence as it will have absolutely no relationship with a previous set of relationship with a previous set of relationship with a previous set of words so a feed forward Network cannot words so a feed forward Network cannot words so a feed forward Network cannot be used in use cases wherein you have to be used in use cases wherein you have to be used in use cases wherein you have to predict the outcome based on your predict the outcome based on your predict the outcome based on your previous outcome so in a lot of use previous outcome so in a lot of use previous outcome so in a lot of use cases your previous output will also cases your previous output will also cases your previous output will also determine your next output so for such determine your next output so for such determine your next output so for such cases you cannot make use of feed cases you cannot make use of feed cases you cannot make use of feed forward Network now what modification forward Network now what modification forward Network now what modification can you make so that your network can can you make so that your network can can you make so that your network can learn from your previous mistakes for learn from your previous mistakes for learn from your previous mistakes for this we have a solution so a solution to this we have a solution so a solution to this we have a solution so a solution to this is recurrent neural networks so this is recurrent neural networks so this is recurrent neural networks so basically let's say you have an input at basically let's say you have an input at basically let's say you have an input at time T minus one and you'll get some time T minus one and you'll get some time T minus one and you'll get some output when you feed it to the network output when you feed it to the network output when you feed it to the network now some information from this input at now some information from this input at now some information from this input at T minus one is fed to the next input T minus one is fed to the next input T minus one is fed to the next input which is input at time T some which is input at time T some which is input at time T some information from this output is fed into information from this output is fed into information from this output is fed into the next input which is input at T +1 so the next input which is input at T +1 so the next input which is input at T +1 so basically you keep feeding information basically you keep feeding information basically you keep feeding information from the previous input to the next from the previous input to the next from the previous input to the next input that's how recurrent neural input that's how recurrent neural input that's how recurrent neural networks really work so recurrent networks really work so recurrent networks really work so recurrent networks are a type of artificial neural networks are a type of artificial neural networks are a type of artificial neural networks designed to recognize patterns networks designed to recognize patterns networks designed to recognize patterns in sequence of data such as text genomes in sequence of data such as text genomes in sequence of data such as text genomes handwriting spoken words time series handwriting spoken words time series handwriting spoken words time series data sensors talk markets and government data sensors talk markets and government data sensors talk markets and government agencies so guys record and neural agencies so guys record and neural agencies so guys record and neural networks are actually a very important networks are actually a very important networks are actually a very important part of deep learning because recurent part of deep learning because recurent part of deep learning because recurent neural networks have applications in a neural networks have applications in a neural networks have applications in a lot lot of domains okay in Time series lot lot of domains okay in Time series lot lot of domains okay in Time series and in stock markets the main networks and in stock markets the main networks and in stock markets the main networks that I use are recurent neural networks that I use are recurent neural networks that I use are recurent neural networks because each of your inputs are because each of your inputs are because each of your inputs are correlated now to better understand correlated now to better understand correlated now to better understand recurrent neural networks let's consider recurrent neural networks let's consider recurrent neural networks let's consider a small example let's say that you go to a small example let's say that you go to a small example let's say that you go to the gym regularly and the trainer has the gym regularly and the trainer has the gym regularly and the trainer has given you a schedule for your workout so given you a schedule for your workout so given you a schedule for your workout so basically the exercises are repeated basically the exercises are repeated basically the exercises are repeated after every third day okay this is what after every third day okay this is what after every third day okay this is what your schedule looks like so make a note your schedule looks like so make a note your schedule looks like so make a note that all these these exercises are that all these these exercises are that all these these exercises are repeated in a proper order or in a repeated in a proper order or in a repeated in a proper order or in a sequence every week first let us use a sequence every week first let us use a sequence every week first let us use a feed forward Network to try and predict feed forward Network to try and predict feed forward Network to try and predict the type of exercise that we're going to the type of exercise that we're going to the type of exercise that we're going to do the inputs here are day of the week do the inputs here are day of the week do the inputs here are day of the week the month and your health status okay so the month and your health status okay so the month and your health status okay so a neural network has to be trained using a neural network has to be trained using a neural network has to be trained using these inputs to provide us with the these inputs to provide us with the these inputs to provide us with the prediction of the exercises that we prediction of the exercises that we prediction of the exercises that we should do now let's try and understand should do now let's try and understand should do now let's try and understand the same thing using recurrent neural the same thing using recurrent neural the same thing using recurrent neural networks in recurrent neural networks networks in recurrent neural networks networks in recurrent neural networks what we'll do is we'll consider the what we'll do is we'll consider the what we'll do is we'll consider the inputs of the previous day okay so if inputs of the previous day okay so if inputs of the previous day okay so if you did a shoulder workout yesterday you did a shoulder workout yesterday you did a shoulder workout yesterday then you can do a bicep exercise today then you can do a bicep exercise today then you can do a bicep exercise today and this goes on for the rest of the and this goes on for the rest of the and this goes on for the rest of the week however if you happen to miss a day week however if you happen to miss a day week however if you happen to miss a day at the gym the data from the previously at the gym the data from the previously at the gym the data from the previously attended time stamps can be considered attended time stamps can be considered attended time stamps can be considered right it can be done like this so if a right it can be done like this so if a right it can be done like this so if a model is trained based on the data it model is trained based on the data it model is trained based on the data it can obtain from the previous exercise can obtain from the previous exercise can obtain from the previous exercise the output from the model will be the output from the model will be the output from the model will be extremely accurate in such cases you extremely accurate in such cases you extremely accurate in such cases you need to know the output at T minus one need to know the output at T minus one need to know the output at T minus one in order to predict the output at d in order to predict the output at d in order to predict the output at d right in such cases recurent neural right in such cases recurent neural right in such cases recurent neural networks are very essential so basically networks are very essential so basically networks are very essential so basically on feeding some inputs to the neural on feeding some inputs to the neural on feeding some inputs to the neural networks you'll go through a few networks you'll go through a few networks you'll go through a few functions and you'll get the output so functions and you'll get the output so functions and you'll get the output so basically you're predicting the output basically you're predicting the output basically you're predicting the output based on past information or based on based on past information or based on based on past information or based on your past input so that's how recurrent your past input so that's how recurrent your past input so that's how recurrent neural networks work now let's look at neural networks work now let's look at neural networks work now let's look at another type of neural network known as another type of neural network known as another type of neural network known as convolutional neural network to convolutional neural network to convolutional neural network to understand why we need convolutional understand why we need convolutional understand why we need convolutional neural neural networks let's look at an neural neural networks let's look at an neural neural networks let's look at an analogy how do you think a computer analogy how do you think a computer analogy how do you think a computer reads an image okay consider this image reads an image okay consider this image reads an image okay consider this image okay this is a New York skyline image on okay this is a New York skyline image on okay this is a New York skyline image on the first glance you'll see a lot of the first glance you'll see a lot of the first glance you'll see a lot of buildings and a lot of colors now how buildings and a lot of colors now how buildings and a lot of colors now how does a computer process this image the does a computer process this image the does a computer process this image the image is actually broken down into three image is actually broken down into three image is actually broken down into three color channels which is red green and color channels which is red green and color channels which is red green and blue all right it reads in the form of blue all right it reads in the form of blue all right it reads in the form of RGB values now each of these color RGB values now each of these color RGB values now each of these color channels are mapped to the images pixel channels are mapped to the images pixel channels are mapped to the images pixel then the computer will recognize the then the computer will recognize the then the computer will recognize the value associated with each pixel and value associated with each pixel and value associated with each pixel and determine the size of the image now for determine the size of the image now for determine the size of the image now for the black and white images there is only the black and white images there is only the black and white images there is only one channel but the concept is still the one channel but the concept is still the one channel but the concept is still the same the thing is we cannot make use of same the thing is we cannot make use of same the thing is we cannot make use of fully connected networks when it comes fully connected networks when it comes fully connected networks when it comes to convolutional neural networks I'll to convolutional neural networks I'll to convolutional neural networks I'll tell you why now consider the first tell you why now consider the first tell you why now consider the first input image okay first image has a size input image okay first image has a size input image okay first image has a size about 28 into 28 into 3 pixels and uh if about 28 into 28 into 3 pixels and uh if about 28 into 28 into 3 pixels and uh if we input this to our neural network we input this to our neural network we input this to our neural network we'll get about 2,00 we'll get about 2,00 we'll get about 2,00 352 weights in the first hidden layer 352 weights in the first hidden layer 352 weights in the first hidden layer itself now consider another example okay itself now consider another example okay itself now consider another example okay let's say we have an image of 200 into let's say we have an image of 200 into let's say we have an image of 200 into 200 into 3 pixels so the size of your 200 into 3 pixels so the size of your 200 into 3 pixels so the size of your first hidden layer becomes around first hidden layer becomes around first hidden layer becomes around 120,000 now if this is just the first 120,000 now if this is just the first 120,000 now if this is just the first hidden layer imagine the number of hidden layer imagine the number of hidden layer imagine the number of neurons that you need to process an neurons that you need to process an neurons that you need to process an entire complex image set right this entire complex image set right this entire complex image set right this leads to something known as overfitting leads to something known as overfitting leads to something known as overfitting because all of the Hidden layers are because all of the Hidden layers are because all of the Hidden layers are connected they are massively connected connected they are massively connected connected they are massively connected there's connection between each and there's connection between each and there's connection between each and every node because of this we face every node because of this we face every node because of this we face overfitting right we have way too much overfitting right we have way too much overfitting right we have way too much of data we have to use way too many of data we have to use way too many of data we have to use way too many neurons which is not practical so that's neurons which is not practical so that's neurons which is not practical so that's why we have something known as why we have something known as why we have something known as convolutional neural networks now convolutional neural networks now convolutional neural networks now convolutional neural networks like any convolutional neural networks like any convolutional neural networks like any other neural network are made up of other neural network are made up of other neural network are made up of neurons with learnable weights and bases neurons with learnable weights and bases neurons with learnable weights and bases so each neuron receives several inputs so each neuron receives several inputs so each neuron receives several inputs it takes a weighted sum over them and it it takes a weighted sum over them and it it takes a weighted sum over them and it gets passed on through some activation gets passed on through some activation gets passed on through some activation function and finally responds with an function and finally responds with an function and finally responds with an output so the concept in convolution output so the concept in convolution output so the concept in convolution neural networks is that the neuron in a neural networks is that the neuron in a neural networks is that the neuron in a particular layer will only be connected particular layer will only be connected particular layer will only be connected to a small region of the layer before it to a small region of the layer before it to a small region of the layer before it not all the neurons will be connected in not all the neurons will be connected in not all the neurons will be connected in a fully connected manner which leads to a fully connected manner which leads to a fully connected manner which leads to overfitting because we need way too many overfitting because we need way too many overfitting because we need way too many neurons to solve this problem only the neurons to solve this problem only the neurons to solve this problem only the regions which are significant are regions which are significant are regions which are significant are connected to each other all right there connected to each other all right there connected to each other all right there is no full Connection in convolution is no full Connection in convolution is no full Connection in convolution

I'll also leave a couple of links in the I'll also leave a couple of links in the I'll also leave a couple of links in the description box so that you understand description box so that you understand description box so that you understand the whole deep learning in a better way the whole deep learning in a better way the whole deep learning in a better way okay if you want a more in-depth okay if you want a more in-depth okay if you want a more in-depth explanation I'll leave a couple of links explanation I'll leave a couple of links explanation I'll leave a couple of links in the description box for now what I'm in the description box for now what I'm in the description box for now what I'm going to do is I'll be running a going to do is I'll be running a going to do is I'll be running a practical demonstration to show you what practical demonstration to show you what practical demonstration to show you what exactly deep learning does so basically exactly deep learning does so basically exactly deep learning does so basically what we're going to do in this demo is what we're going to do in this demo is what we're going to do in this demo is we're going to predict stock prices and we're going to predict stock prices and we're going to predict stock prices and like I said stock price prediction is like I said stock price prediction is like I said stock price prediction is one of the very uh good applications of one of the very uh good applications of one of the very uh good applications of deep neural networks you can easily deep neural networks you can easily deep neural networks you can easily predict the stock price of a particular predict the stock price of a particular predict the stock price of a particular stock for the next minute or the next stock for the next minute or the next stock for the next minute or the next day by using deep neural networks right day by using deep neural networks right day by using deep neural networks right so that's exactly what we're going to do so that's exactly what we're going to do so that's exactly what we're going to do in this demo now before I discuss the in this demo now before I discuss the in this demo now before I discuss the code let me tell you a few things about code let me tell you a few things about code let me tell you a few things about our data set okay the data set contains our data set okay the data set contains our data set okay the data set contains around 42,000 minutes of data ranging around 42,000 minutes of data ranging around 42,000 minutes of data ranging from April to August 2017 on 500 stocks from April to August 2017 on 500 stocks from April to August 2017 on 500 stocks as well as the total S&amp;P 500 index price as well as the total S&amp;P 500 index price as well as the total S&amp;P 500 index price so the index and stocks are arranged in so the index and stocks are arranged in so the index and stocks are arranged in a wide format so this is my data set a wide format so this is my data set a wide format so this is my data set dataor stocks it's in the CSV format so dataor stocks it's in the CSV format so dataor stocks it's in the CSV format so what I'm going to do is I'm going to use what I'm going to do is I'm going to use what I'm going to do is I'm going to use the read CSV function in order to import the read CSV function in order to import the read CSV function in order to import this data set right this is just the this data set right this is just the this data set right this is just the path of where my data set is stored this path of where my data set is stored this path of where my data set is stored this data set was actually cleaned and data set was actually cleaned and data set was actually cleaned and prepared meaning that we don't have any prepared meaning that we don't have any prepared meaning that we don't have any missing stock and index prices so the missing stock and index prices so the missing stock and index prices so the file does not contain any missing values file does not contain any missing values file does not contain any missing values now what we're going to do first is now what we're going to do first is now what we're going to do first is we'll drop the date variable we have a we'll drop the date variable we have a we'll drop the date variable we have a variable known as date which is not variable known as date which is not variable known as date which is not really necessary in predicting our really necessary in predicting our really necessary in predicting our outcome come over here so that's exactly outcome come over here so that's exactly outcome come over here so that's exactly what I'm doing here I'm just dropping what I'm doing here I'm just dropping what I'm doing here I'm just dropping the date variable so here I'm just the date variable so here I'm just the date variable so here I'm just checking the dimensions of the data set checking the dimensions of the data set checking the dimensions of the data set right this is pretty understandable right this is pretty understandable right this is pretty understandable you're using the shape function to do you're using the shape function to do you're using the shape function to do that now always you make the data as a that now always you make the data as a that now always you make the data as a numpy array right this makes computation numpy array right this makes computation numpy array right this makes computation much easier the next process is the data much easier the next process is the data much easier the next process is the data splicing I've already discussed data splicing I've already discussed data splicing I've already discussed data splicing with you all here we're just splicing with you all here we're just splicing with you all here we're just preparing the training and the testing preparing the training and the testing preparing the training and the testing data so the training data will contain data so the training data will contain data so the training data will contain 80% of the total data set okay and ALS 80% of the total data set okay and ALS 80% of the total data set okay and ALS so we are not shuffling the data set so we are not shuffling the data set so we are not shuffling the data set we're just slicing the data set we're just slicing the data set we're just slicing the data set sequentially right that's why we have a sequentially right that's why we have a sequentially right that's why we have a test start and the test end variable in test start and the test end variable in test start and the test end variable in sequence itself is selecting the data sequence itself is selecting the data sequence itself is selecting the data there's no need of shuffling this data there's no need of shuffling this data there's no need of shuffling this data set right these are stock prices it does set right these are stock prices it does set right these are stock prices it does not make sense to shuffle this data now not make sense to shuffle this data now not make sense to shuffle this data now the next step we're going to do is we're the next step we're going to do is we're the next step we're going to do is we're going to scale the data now scaling data going to scale the data now scaling data going to scale the data now scaling data and data normalization is one of the and data normalization is one of the and data normalization is one of the most important steps all right you most important steps all right you most important steps all right you cannot miss this step I already cannot miss this step I already cannot miss this step I already mentioned earlier what normalizing ation mentioned earlier what normalizing ation mentioned earlier what normalizing ation and scaling is now most neural networks and scaling is now most neural networks and scaling is now most neural networks benefit from scaling inputs this is benefit from scaling inputs this is benefit from scaling inputs this is because most common activation functions because most common activation functions because most common activation functions of the network neurons such as tan hedge of the network neurons such as tan hedge of the network neurons such as tan hedge and sigmoid tan HED and sigmoid are and sigmoid tan HED and sigmoid are and sigmoid tan HED and sigmoid are basically activation functions and these basically activation functions and these basically activation functions and these are defined in the range of minus1 to 1 are defined in the range of minus1 to 1 are defined in the range of minus1 to 1 or 0o and 1 so that's why scaling is an or 0o and 1 so that's why scaling is an or 0o and 1 so that's why scaling is an important thing in deep neural networks important thing in deep neural networks important thing in deep neural networks for scaling again we'll use the minmax for scaling again we'll use the minmax for scaling again we'll use the minmax scaler all right so we're just importing scaler all right so we're just importing scaler all right so we're just importing that function over here and also want that function over here and also want that function over here and also want point to note is that you have to be point to note is that you have to be point to note is that you have to be very cautious about what part of data very cautious about what part of data very cautious about what part of data you're scaling and when you're doing it you're scaling and when you're doing it you're scaling and when you're doing it a very common mistake is to scale the a very common mistake is to scale the a very common mistake is to scale the whole data set before training and test whole data set before training and test whole data set before training and test splits are being applied all right so splits are being applied all right so splits are being applied all right so before data splicing itself you before data splicing itself you before data splicing itself you shouldn't be scaling your data now this shouldn't be scaling your data now this shouldn't be scaling your data now this is a mistake because scaling invokes the is a mistake because scaling invokes the is a mistake because scaling invokes the calculation of statistics for example calculation of statistics for example calculation of statistics for example minimum or maximum uh range of the minimum or maximum uh range of the minimum or maximum uh range of the variable gets affected so when variable gets affected so when variable gets affected so when performing uh Time series forecasting in performing uh Time series forecasting in performing uh Time series forecasting in real life you do not have information real life you do not have information real life you do not have information from future observations at the time of from future observations at the time of from future observations at the time of forecasting that's why calculation of forecasting that's why calculation of forecasting that's why calculation of scaling statistics has to be conducted scaling statistics has to be conducted scaling statistics has to be conducted on training data and only then it has to on training data and only then it has to on training data and only then it has to be applied to the test data otherwise be applied to the test data otherwise be applied to the test data otherwise you're basically using the future you're basically using the future you're basically using the future information at the time of forecasting information at the time of forecasting information at the time of forecasting which is obviously going to lead to which is obviously going to lead to which is obviously going to lead to biasness right so that's why you need to biasness right so that's why you need to biasness right so that's why you need to make sure you do scaling very accurately make sure you do scaling very accurately make sure you do scaling very accurately so basically what we're doing is the so basically what we're doing is the so basically what we're doing is the number of features in the training data number of features in the training data number of features in the training data are stored in a variable known as end are stored in a variable known as end are stored in a variable known as end stocks after this we'll import the stocks after this we'll import the stocks after this we'll import the infamous tensorflow so guys tensorflow infamous tensorflow so guys tensorflow infamous tensorflow so guys tensorflow is actually a very uh good piece of is actually a very uh good piece of is actually a very uh good piece of software and it is currently the leading software and it is currently the leading software and it is currently the leading deep learning and neural network deep learning and neural network deep learning and neural network computation framework right it is based computation framework right it is based computation framework right it is based on a C++ lowlevel back end but it's on a C++ lowlevel back end but it's on a C++ lowlevel back end but it's usually controlled through python so T usually controlled through python so T usually controlled through python so T oflow actually operates as a graphical oflow actually operates as a graphical oflow actually operates as a graphical representation of your computations and representation of your computations and representation of your computations and this is important because neural this is important because neural this is important because neural networks are actually graphs of data and networks are actually graphs of data and networks are actually graphs of data and mathematical operations so that's why mathematical operations so that's why mathematical operations so that's why tensor flow is just perfect for neural tensor flow is just perfect for neural tensor flow is just perfect for neural networks and deep learning so the next networks and deep learning so the next networks and deep learning so the next thing after importing the tensorflow thing after importing the tensorflow thing after importing the tensorflow library is something known as library is something known as library is something known as placeholders placeholders are used to placeholders placeholders are used to placeholders placeholders are used to store input and Target data right we store input and Target data right we store input and Target data right we need two placeholders in order to fit a need two placeholders in order to fit a need two placeholders in order to fit a model so basically X will contain the model so basically X will contain the model so basically X will contain the network input which is the stock prices network input which is the stock prices network input which is the stock prices of all the uh stocks at time t equal to of all the uh stocks at time t equal to of all the uh stocks at time t equal to T and why will contain the Network's T and why will contain the Network's T and why will contain the Network's output which is the stock price at time output which is the stock price at time output which is the stock price at time T is equal to t + 1 now the shape of the T is equal to t + 1 now the shape of the T is equal to t + 1 now the shape of the X Place holder u means that the inputs X Place holder u means that the inputs X Place holder u means that the inputs are a two-dimensional Matrix and the are a two-dimensional Matrix and the are a two-dimensional Matrix and the outputs are a one-dimensional vector so outputs are a one-dimensional vector so outputs are a one-dimensional vector so guys basically the nonone argument guys basically the nonone argument guys basically the nonone argument indicates that at this point we do not indicates that at this point we do not indicates that at this point we do not yet know the number of observations that yet know the number of observations that yet know the number of observations that will flow through the neural network we will flow through the neural network we will flow through the neural network we just keep it as a flexible array for now just keep it as a flexible array for now just keep it as a flexible array for now we will later Define the variable bat we will later Define the variable bat we will later Define the variable bat side is that controls the number of side is that controls the number of side is that controls the number of observations in each training batch all observations in each training batch all observations in each training batch all right now apart from this we also have right now apart from this we also have right now apart from this we also have something known as something known as something known as initializers now uh before I tell you initializers now uh before I tell you initializers now uh before I tell you what these initializers are you need to what these initializers are you need to what these initializers are you need to understand that there's something known understand that there's something known understand that there's something known as variables that are used as flexible as variables that are used as flexible as variables that are used as flexible containers that are allowed to change containers that are allowed to change containers that are allowed to change during the execution weights and bias during the execution weights and bias during the execution weights and bias are represented as variables in order to are represented as variables in order to are represented as variables in order to adapt during training I already adapt during training I already adapt during training I already discussed weights and bias with you discussed weights and bias with you discussed weights and bias with you earlier here now weights and bias is earlier here now weights and bias is earlier here now weights and bias is something that you need to initialize something that you need to initialize something that you need to initialize before you train the model right that's before you train the model right that's before you train the model right that's how we discussed it even uh while I was how we discussed it even uh while I was how we discussed it even uh while I was explaining neural networks to you so explaining neural networks to you so explaining neural networks to you so here basically we make use of something here basically we make use of something here basically we make use of something known as variance scaling initializer known as variance scaling initializer known as variance scaling initializer and for B initializer we make use of Zer and for B initializer we make use of Zer and for B initializer we make use of Zer initializers these are some predefined initializers these are some predefined initializers these are some predefined functions in our tensorflow module right functions in our tensorflow module right functions in our tensorflow module right we'll not get into the depth of those we'll not get into the depth of those we'll not get into the depth of those things now let's look at our model things now let's look at our model things now let's look at our model architecture parameters so the next architecture parameters so the next architecture parameters so the next thing we have to disc discuss is the thing we have to disc discuss is the thing we have to disc discuss is the model architecture parameters now the model architecture parameters now the model architecture parameters now the model that we built it consists of four model that we built it consists of four model that we built it consists of four hidden layers for the first layer we hidden layers for the first layer we hidden layers for the first layer we have assigned 1024 neurons which is have assigned 1024 neurons which is have assigned 1024 neurons which is slightly more than double the size of slightly more than double the size of slightly more than double the size of the inputs the subsequent hidden layers the inputs the subsequent hidden layers the inputs the subsequent hidden layers are always half the size of the previous are always half the size of the previous are always half the size of the previous layer which means that in the hidden layer which means that in the hidden layer which means that in the hidden layer number two we'll have 512 neurons layer number two we'll have 512 neurons layer number two we'll have 512 neurons hidden layer three will have 256 and hidden layer three will have 256 and hidden layer three will have 256 and similarly hidden layer number four will similarly hidden layer number four will similarly hidden layer number four will have 128 neurons now why do we keep have 128 neurons now why do we keep have 128 neurons now why do we keep reducing the number of neurons as we go reducing the number of neurons as we go reducing the number of neurons as we go through each hidden layer we do this through each hidden layer we do this through each hidden layer we do this because the number of neurons for each because the number of neurons for each because the number of neurons for each subsequent layer compresses the subsequent layer compresses the subsequent layer compresses the information that the network identifies information that the network identifies information that the network identifies in the previous layer of course there in the previous layer of course there in the previous layer of course there are other possible Network architectures are other possible Network architectures are other possible Network architectures that you can apply for this problem that you can apply for this problem that you can apply for this problem statement but I'm trying to keep it as statement but I'm trying to keep it as statement but I'm trying to keep it as simple as possible because I'm simple as possible because I'm simple as possible because I'm introducing deep learning to you all so introducing deep learning to you all so introducing deep learning to you all so I can't build a model architecture I can't build a model architecture I can't build a model architecture that's very complex and hard to explain that's very complex and hard to explain that's very complex and hard to explain and of course we have our output over and of course we have our output over and of course we have our output over here which will be assigned a single here which will be assigned a single here which will be assigned a single neuron now it is very important to neuron now it is very important to neuron now it is very important to understand the variable Dimensions understand the variable Dimensions understand the variable Dimensions between your input hidden and output between your input hidden and output between your input hidden and output layers so as a rule of thumb in layers so as a rule of thumb in layers so as a rule of thumb in multi-layer perceptrons the second multi-layer perceptrons the second multi-layer perceptrons the second dimension of the previous layer is the dimension of the previous layer is the dimension of the previous layer is the First Dimension in the current layer so First Dimension in the current layer so First Dimension in the current layer so the second dimension in my first hidden the second dimension in my first hidden the second dimension in my first hidden layer is going to be my first dimension layer is going to be my first dimension layer is going to be my first dimension in my second hidden layer now the reason in my second hidden layer now the reason in my second hidden layer now the reason behind this is pretty logical it's behind this is pretty logical it's behind this is pretty logical it's because the output from the first hidden because the output from the first hidden because the output from the first hidden layer is passed on as an input to the layer is passed on as an input to the layer is passed on as an input to the second hidden layer that's why the second hidden layer that's why the second hidden layer that's why the second dimension of the previous layer second dimension of the previous layer second dimension of the previous layer is the same as the first dimension of is the same as the first dimension of is the same as the first dimension of the next layer or the current layer all the next layer or the current layer all the next layer or the current layer all right I hope this is understandable now right I hope this is understandable now right I hope this is understandable now coming to the biased Dimension over here coming to the biased Dimension over here coming to the biased Dimension over here the bias Dimension is always equal to the bias Dimension is always equal to the bias Dimension is always equal to the second dimension of your current the second dimension of your current the second dimension of your current layer meaning that you're just going to layer meaning that you're just going to layer meaning that you're just going to pass the number of neurons in that pass the number of neurons in that pass the number of neurons in that particular hidden layer as your particular hidden layer as your particular hidden layer as your dimension in your bias so here the dimension in your bias so here the dimension in your bias so here the number of neurons are 1024 you're number of neurons are 1024 you're number of neurons are 1024 you're passing the same number as a parameter passing the same number as a parameter passing the same number as a parameter to your bias similarly even for hidden to your bias similarly even for hidden to your bias similarly even for hidden layer number two if you see our second layer number two if you see our second layer number two if you see our second dimension here is n neurons uncore 2 I'm dimension here is n neurons uncore 2 I'm dimension here is n neurons uncore 2 I'm passing the same parameter over here as passing the same parameter over here as passing the same parameter over here as well similarly for hidden layer three well similarly for hidden layer three well similarly for hidden layer three and hidden layer number and hidden layer number and hidden layer number four right I hope this is understandable four right I hope this is understandable four right I hope this is understandable now we come to the output layer the now we come to the output layer the now we come to the output layer the output layer will obviously have the output layer will obviously have the output layer will obviously have the output from hidden layer number four output from hidden layer number four output from hidden layer number four this is our output from hidden layer this is our output from hidden layer this is our output from hidden layer four that's passed as the First four that's passed as the First four that's passed as the First Dimension in our output layer and it'll Dimension in our output layer and it'll Dimension in our output layer and it'll finally have your end Target which is finally have your end Target which is finally have your end Target which is set to one over here right this is our set to one over here right this is our set to one over here right this is our output your bias will basically have the output your bias will basically have the output your bias will basically have the current layer's Dimension which is end current layer's Dimension which is end current layer's Dimension which is end Target we're passing that same parameter Target we're passing that same parameter Target we're passing that same parameter over over over here now after you define the required here now after you define the required here now after you define the required weight and the bias variables the weight and the bias variables the weight and the bias variables the architecture of the network has to be architecture of the network has to be architecture of the network has to be specified what you do is placeholders specified what you do is placeholders specified what you do is placeholders and variables need to be combined into a and variables need to be combined into a and variables need to be combined into a system of sequential matrix system of sequential matrix system of sequential matrix multiplication so that's exactly what's multiplication so that's exactly what's multiplication so that's exactly what's happening over here apart from this all happening over here apart from this all happening over here apart from this all the hidden layers need to be transformed the hidden layers need to be transformed the hidden layers need to be transformed right by using the activation function right by using the activation function right by using the activation function so activation functions are important so activation functions are important so activation functions are important components of the network because they components of the network because they components of the network because they introduce nonlinearity to the system introduce nonlinearity to the system introduce nonlinearity to the system right this means that high dimensional right this means that high dimensional right this means that high dimensional data can be dealt with with the help of data can be dealt with with the help of data can be dealt with with the help of activation functions obviously we have activation functions obviously we have activation functions obviously we have very high dimensional data when it comes very high dimensional data when it comes very high dimensional data when it comes to neural networks we don't have a to neural networks we don't have a to neural networks we don't have a single Dimension or you know we don't single Dimension or you know we don't single Dimension or you know we don't have two or three inputs we have have two or three inputs we have have two or three inputs we have thousands and thousands of inputs so in thousands and thousands of inputs so in thousands and thousands of inputs so in order for our neural network to process order for our neural network to process order for our neural network to process that much of high dimensional data we that much of high dimensional data we that much of high dimensional data we need something known as activation need something known as activation need something known as activation functions right that's why we make use functions right that's why we make use functions right that's why we make use of activation functions now there are of activation functions now there are of activation functions now there are dozens of activation functions and one dozens of activation functions and one dozens of activation functions and one of the most common one is the rectified of the most common one is the rectified of the most common one is the rectified linear unit rectified linear unit Ru is linear unit rectified linear unit Ru is linear unit rectified linear unit Ru is nothing but rectified linear unit which nothing but rectified linear unit which nothing but rectified linear unit which is what we're going to be using using in is what we're going to be using using in is what we're going to be using using in this model so after you apply the this model so after you apply the this model so after you apply the transformation function to your hidden transformation function to your hidden transformation function to your hidden layer you need to make sure that your layer you need to make sure that your layer you need to make sure that your output is transposed this is followed by output is transposed this is followed by output is transposed this is followed by a very important function known as cost a very important function known as cost a very important function known as cost function so the cost function of a function so the cost function of a function so the cost function of a network is used to generate a measure of network is used to generate a measure of network is used to generate a measure of deviation between the Network's deviation between the Network's deviation between the Network's prediction and the actual observed prediction and the actual observed prediction and the actual observed training targets so this is basically training targets so this is basically training targets so this is basically your actual output minus your model your actual output minus your model your actual output minus your model output it basically calculates the error output it basically calculates the error output it basically calculates the error between your actual output and your between your actual output and your between your actual output and your predicted output so for regression predicted output so for regression predicted output so for regression problems the mean squared error function problems the mean squared error function problems the mean squared error function is commonly used right I have discussed is commonly used right I have discussed is commonly used right I have discussed msse mean squared error before so msse mean squared error before so msse mean squared error before so basically we just measuring the basically we just measuring the basically we just measuring the deviation over here right msse is deviation over here right msse is deviation over here right msse is nothing but your deviation from your nothing but your deviation from your nothing but your deviation from your actual output all right that's exactly actual output all right that's exactly actual output all right that's exactly what we're doing here so after you've what we're doing here so after you've what we're doing here so after you've computed your error the next step is computed your error the next step is computed your error the next step is obviously to update your weight and your obviously to update your weight and your obviously to update your weight and your bias so we have something known as the bias so we have something known as the bias so we have something known as the optimizers they basically take care of optimizers they basically take care of optimizers they basically take care of all the necessary computations that are all the necessary computations that are all the necessary computations that are needed to adapt the Network's weight and needed to adapt the Network's weight and needed to adapt the Network's weight and bias variables during the training phase bias variables during the training phase bias variables during the training phase right that's exactly what's happening right that's exactly what's happening right that's exactly what's happening over here now the main function of this over here now the main function of this over here now the main function of this Optimizer is that it invokes something Optimizer is that it invokes something Optimizer is that it invokes something known as the gradient now if you all known as the gradient now if you all known as the gradient now if you all remember we discussed gradient before it remember we discussed gradient before it remember we discussed gradient before it basically indicates the direction in basically indicates the direction in basically indicates the direction in which the weights and the bias have to which the weights and the bias have to which the weights and the bias have to be changed during the training in order be changed during the training in order be changed during the training in order to minimize the network cost function or to minimize the network cost function or to minimize the network cost function or the network error so you need to figure the network error so you need to figure the network error so you need to figure out whether you need to increase the out whether you need to increase the out whether you need to increase the weight and the bias in order to decrease weight and the bias in order to decrease weight and the bias in order to decrease the error or is it the other way around the error or is it the other way around the error or is it the other way around right you need to understand the right you need to understand the right you need to understand the relationship between your error and your relationship between your error and your relationship between your error and your weight variable right that's exactly weight variable right that's exactly weight variable right that's exactly what the optimizer does it invokes the what the optimizer does it invokes the what the optimizer does it invokes the gradient which will give you the gradient which will give you the gradient which will give you the direction in which the weights and the direction in which the weights and the direction in which the weights and the bias have to be changed right so now bias have to be changed right so now bias have to be changed right so now that you know what an Optimizer does in that you know what an Optimizer does in that you know what an Optimizer does in our module we'll be using something our module we'll be using something our module we'll be using something known as the adom optimizer this is one known as the adom optimizer this is one known as the adom optimizer this is one of the current default optimizers in of the current default optimizers in of the current default optimizers in deep learning Adam basically stands for deep learning Adam basically stands for deep learning Adam basically stands for adaptive moment estimation and it can be adaptive moment estimation and it can be adaptive moment estimation and it can be considered as a combination between very considered as a combination between very considered as a combination between very two popular optimizers called adagrad two popular optimizers called adagrad two popular optimizers called adagrad and RMS prop now let's not get into the and RMS prop now let's not get into the and RMS prop now let's not get into the depth of the optimizers the main agenda depth of the optimizers the main agenda depth of the optimizers the main agenda here is for you to understand the logic here is for you to understand the logic here is for you to understand the logic behind deep learning we don't have to go behind deep learning we don't have to go behind deep learning we don't have to go into the functions and all these are into the functions and all these are into the functions and all these are predefined functions which tensor FL predefined functions which tensor FL predefined functions which tensor FL takes care of next we have something takes care of next we have something takes care of next we have something known as initializers now initializer known as initializers now initializer known as initializers now initializer are used to initialize the network are used to initialize the network are used to initialize the network variables before training we already variables before training we already variables before training we already discussed this before now I Define the discussed this before now I Define the discussed this before now I Define the initializer here again I'd already done initializer here again I'd already done initializer here again I'd already done it earlier in this session right it earlier in this session right it earlier in this session right initializers are already defined so I initializers are already defined so I initializers are already defined so I just removed that line of code Next Step just removed that line of code Next Step just removed that line of code Next Step would be fitting the neural network so would be fitting the neural network so would be fitting the neural network so after we've defined the placeholders the after we've defined the placeholders the after we've defined the placeholders the variables variables which are basically variables variables which are basically variables variables which are basically weights and bias the initializers the weights and bias the initializers the weights and bias the initializers the cost functions and the optimizers of the cost functions and the optimizers of the cost functions and the optimizers of the network the the model has to be trained network the the model has to be trained network the the model has to be trained now this is usually done by using the now this is usually done by using the now this is usually done by using the mini batch Training Method because we mini batch Training Method because we mini batch Training Method because we have a very huge data set right so it's have a very huge data set right so it's have a very huge data set right so it's always best to use the mini batch always best to use the mini batch always best to use the mini batch Training Method now what happens during Training Method now what happens during Training Method now what happens during mini batch training is random data mini batch training is random data mini batch training is random data samples of any bat size are drawn from samples of any bat size are drawn from samples of any bat size are drawn from the training data and they are fed into the training data and they are fed into the training data and they are fed into the network so the training data set the network so the training data set the network so the training data set gets divided into n divided by your gets divided into n divided by your gets divided into n divided by your batch size batches that are sequentially batch size batches that are sequentially batch size batches that are sequentially fed into the network so one after the fed into the network so one after the fed into the network so one after the other each of these batches will be fed other each of these batches will be fed other each of these batches will be fed into the network at this point the into the network at this point the into the network at this point the placeholders which are your X and Y they placeholders which are your X and Y they placeholders which are your X and Y they come into play they store the input and come into play they store the input and come into play they store the input and the target data and present them to the the target data and present them to the the target data and present them to the network as inputs and targets that's the network as inputs and targets that's the network as inputs and targets that's the main functionality of placeholders what main functionality of placeholders what main functionality of placeholders what they do is they store the input and the they do is they store the input and the they do is they store the input and the target data and they provide this to the target data and they provide this to the target data and they provide this to the network as inputs and targets that's network as inputs and targets that's network as inputs and targets that's exactly what your placeholders do so exactly what your placeholders do so exactly what your placeholders do so let's say that a sampled data batch of x let's say that a sampled data batch of x let's say that a sampled data batch of x right now this data batch flows through right now this data batch flows through right now this data batch flows through the network until it reaches the output the network until it reaches the output the network until it reaches the output layer there the tens of flow compares layer there the tens of flow compares layer there the tens of flow compares the models predictions against the the models predictions against the the models predictions against the actual observed targets which is stored actual observed targets which is stored actual observed targets which is stored in y if you all remember we stored our in y if you all remember we stored our in y if you all remember we stored our actual observed Targets in y after this actual observed Targets in y after this actual observed Targets in y after this tensor flow will conduct something known tensor flow will conduct something known tensor flow will conduct something known as optimization step and it'll update as optimization step and it'll update as optimization step and it'll update the Network's parameters like the weight the Network's parameters like the weight the Network's parameters like the weight of the network and the bias so after of the network and the bias so after of the network and the bias so after having updated your weight and the bias having updated your weight and the bias having updated your weight and the bias the next batch is sampled and the the next batch is sampled and the the next batch is sampled and the process gets repeated so this procedure process gets repeated so this procedure process gets repeated so this procedure will continue until all the batches have will continue until all the batches have will continue until all the batches have presented to the network and one full presented to the network and one full presented to the network and one full sweep over all batches is known as an sweep over all batches is known as an sweep over all batches is known as an Epoch so I've defined this entire thing Epoch so I've defined this entire thing Epoch so I've defined this entire thing over here so we are going to go through over here so we are going to go through over here so we are going to go through 10 epochs meaning that all the batches 10 epochs meaning that all the batches 10 epochs meaning that all the batches are going to go through training meaning are going to go through training meaning are going to go through training meaning you're going to input each batch that is you're going to input each batch that is you're going to input each batch that is X and it will flow through

bias the next batch will get and the bias the next batch will get sampled and the process will keep sampled and the process will keep sampled and the process will keep repeating right this happens until all repeating right this happens until all repeating right this happens until all the batches are implemented in the the batches are implemented in the the batches are implemented in the network so what I just told you was one network so what I just told you was one network so what I just told you was one Epoch we're going to repeat this 10 Epoch we're going to repeat this 10 Epoch we're going to repeat this 10 times so our batch size is 256 meaning times so our batch size is 256 meaning times so our batch size is 256 meaning that we have 256 batches so here we're that we have 256 batches so here we're that we have 256 batches so here we're going to assign X and Y what I just going to assign X and Y what I just going to assign X and Y what I just spoke to you about the mini batch spoke to you about the mini batch spoke to you about the mini batch training starts over here so basically training starts over here so basically training starts over here so basically your first batch will start flowing your first batch will start flowing your first batch will start flowing through the network until it reaches the through the network until it reaches the through the network until it reaches the output layer after this tensor flow We output layer after this tensor flow We output layer after this tensor flow We compare your models prediction this is compare your models prediction this is compare your models prediction this is where predictions happen it'll compare where predictions happen it'll compare where predictions happen it'll compare your models prediction to the actual your models prediction to the actual your models prediction to the actual observed targets which is stored in y observed targets which is stored in y observed targets which is stored in y then tensorflow will start doing then tensorflow will start doing then tensorflow will start doing optimization and it'll update the optimization and it'll update the optimization and it'll update the network parameters like your weight and network parameters like your weight and network parameters like your weight and your bias so after you update the weight your bias so after you update the weight your bias so after you update the weight and the biases the next batch will get and the biases the next batch will get and the biases the next batch will get input into the network and this process input into the network and this process input into the network and this process will keep repeating this process will will keep repeating this process will will keep repeating this process will repeat 10 times because we've defined 10 repeat 10 times because we've defined 10 repeat 10 times because we've defined 10 epochs now also during the training we epochs now also during the training we epochs now also during the training we evaluate the network predictions on the evaluate the network predictions on the evaluate the network predictions on the test set which is basically the data test set which is basically the data test set which is basically the data which we haven't learned but this data which we haven't learned but this data which we haven't learned but this data is set aside for every fifth batch and is set aside for every fifth batch and is set aside for every fifth batch and this is visualized so in our problem this is visualized so in our problem this is visualized so in our problem statement what our network is going to statement what our network is going to statement what our network is going to do is it's going to predict the stock do is it's going to predict the stock do is it's going to predict the stock price continuously over a time period of price continuously over a time period of price continuously over a time period of t+ 1 right we're feeding it data about t+ 1 right we're feeding it data about t+ 1 right we're feeding it data about the stock price at time T it's going to the stock price at time T it's going to the stock price at time T it's going to give us an output of time t + 1 now let give us an output of time t + 1 now let give us an output of time t + 1 now let me run this code and let's see how close me run this code and let's see how close me run this code and let's see how close our predicted values are to the actual our predicted values are to the actual our predicted values are to the actual values we're going to visualize this values we're going to visualize this values we're going to visualize this entire thing and we've also exported entire thing and we've also exported entire thing and we've also exported this in order to combine it into a video this in order to combine it into a video this in order to combine it into a video animation right I'll show you what the animation right I'll show you what the animation right I'll show you what the video looks like so now now let's look video looks like so now now let's look video looks like so now now let's look at our visualization we look at our at our visualization we look at our at our visualization we look at our output so the orange basically shows our output so the orange basically shows our output so the orange basically shows our models prediction so the model quickly models prediction so the model quickly models prediction so the model quickly learns the shape and the location of the learns the shape and the location of the learns the shape and the location of the time series in the test data and showing time series in the test data and showing time series in the test data and showing us an accurate prediction right it's us an accurate prediction right it's us an accurate prediction right it's pretty close to the actual prediction pretty close to the actual prediction pretty close to the actual prediction now as I'm explaining this to you each now as I'm explaining this to you each now as I'm explaining this to you each batch is running here right we are at batch is running here right we are at batch is running here right we are at aepo 2 we have 10 epochs to go over here aepo 2 we have 10 epochs to go over here aepo 2 we have 10 epochs to go over here so you can see that the network is so you can see that the network is so you can see that the network is actually adapting to the basic shape of actually adapting to the basic shape of actually adapting to the basic shape of the time series and it's learned the time series and it's learned the time series and it's learned learning finer patterns in the data you learning finer patterns in the data you learning finer patterns in the data you see it keeps learning patterns and the see it keeps learning patterns and the see it keeps learning patterns and the prediction is getting closer and closer prediction is getting closer and closer prediction is getting closer and closer after every EPO so let's just wait till after every EPO so let's just wait till after every EPO so let's just wait till we reach AO 10 and we complete the we reach AO 10 and we complete the we reach AO 10 and we complete the entire process entire process entire process right so guys I think the predictions right so guys I think the predictions right so guys I think the predictions are pretty close like the pattern and are pretty close like the pattern and are pretty close like the pattern and the shape is learned very well by our the shape is learned very well by our the shape is learned very well by our neural network it is actually mimicking neural network it is actually mimicking neural network it is actually mimicking this network the only deviation is in this network the only deviation is in this network the only deviation is in the values apart from that it's learning the values apart from that it's learning the values apart from that it's learning the shape of the time series data in the shape of the time series data in the shape of the time series data in almost the same way the shape is exactly almost the same way the shape is exactly almost the same way the shape is exactly the same it looks very similar to me now the same it looks very similar to me now the same it looks very similar to me now also remember that there are a lot of also remember that there are a lot of also remember that there are a lot of ways of improving your result you can ways of improving your result you can ways of improving your result you can change the design of your layers or you change the design of your layers or you change the design of your layers or you can change the number of neurons you can can change the number of neurons you can can change the number of neurons you can choose different initialization choose different initialization choose different initialization functions and activation

learning models that you can use for this problem here we use the feed this problem here we use the feed this problem here we use the feed forward Network which basically means forward Network which basically means forward Network which basically means that the batches will flow from left to that the batches will flow from left to that the batches will flow from left to right okay so our 10 EPO are over now right okay so our 10 EPO are over now right okay so our 10 EPO are over now the final thing that's getting the final thing that's getting the final thing that's getting calculated is our error msse or mean calculated is our error msse or mean calculated is our error msse or mean squared error so guys don't worry about squared error so guys don't worry about squared error so guys don't worry about this warning right it's just a warning this warning right it's just a warning this warning right it's just a warning so our mean Square squ error comes down so our mean Square squ error comes down so our mean Square squ error comes down to to to 0.029 which is pretty low because the 0.029 which is pretty low because the 0.029 which is pretty low because the target is scaled and this means that our target is scaled and this means that our target is scaled and this means that our accuracy is pretty good so guys like I accuracy is pretty good so guys like I accuracy is pretty good so guys like I mentioned if you want to improve the mentioned if you want to improve the mentioned if you want to improve the accuracy of the model you can use accuracy of the model you can use accuracy of the model you can use different schemes you can use different different schemes you can use different different schemes you can use different initialization functions or you can try initialization functions or you can try initialization functions or you can try out different transformation functions out different transformation functions out different transformation functions you can use something known as Dropout you can use something known as Dropout you can use something known as Dropout technique and early stopping in order to technique and early stopping in order to technique and early stopping in order to make the training phase even more better make the training phase even more better make the training phase even more better yeah so guys that was the end of our yeah so guys that was the end of our yeah so guys that was the end of our deep learning demo Mo right I hope all deep learning demo Mo right I hope all deep learning demo Mo right I hope all of you understood the Deep learning demo of you understood the Deep learning demo of you understood the Deep learning demo for those of you who are just learning for those of you who are just learning for those of you who are just learning deep learning for the first time it deep learning for the first time it deep learning for the first time it might be a little confusing so if you might be a little confusing so if you might be a little confusing so if you have any doubts regarding the demo let have any doubts regarding the demo let have any doubts regarding the demo let me know in the comment section right me know in the comment section right me know in the comment section right I'll also leave a couple of links in the I'll also leave a couple of links in the I'll also leave a couple of links in the description box so that you can description box so that you can description box so that you can understand deep learning in a little understand deep learning in a little understand deep learning in a little more depth now let's look at our final more depth now let's look at our final more depth now let's look at our final topic for today which is natural topic for today which is natural topic for today which is natural language processing now before we language processing now before we language processing now before we understand what text mining is and what understand what text mining is and what understand what text mining is and what natural language processing is we have natural language processing is we have natural language processing is we have to understand the need for text Mining to understand the need for text Mining to understand the need for text Mining and natural language processing so guys and natural language processing so guys and natural language processing so guys the number one reason why we need text the number one reason why we need text the number one reason why we need text Mining and natural language processing Mining and natural language processing Mining and natural language processing is because of the amount of data that is because of the amount of data that is because of the amount of data that we're generating during this time right we're generating during this time right we're generating during this time right like I mentioned earlier there are like I mentioned earlier there are like I mentioned earlier there are around 2.5 quintilian bytes of data that around 2.5 quintilian bytes of data that around 2.5 quintilian bytes of data that is created every day and this number is is created every day and this number is is created every day and this number is only going to grow with the evolution of only going to grow with the evolution of only going to grow with the evolution of communication through social media we communication through social media we communication through social media we generate tons and tons of data right the generate tons and tons of data right the generate tons and tons of data right the numbers are on your screen now these numbers are on your screen now these numbers are on your screen now these numbers are literally for every minute numbers are literally for every minute numbers are literally for every minute on Instagram every minute 1.7 million on Instagram every minute 1.7 million on Instagram every minute 1.7 million pictures are posted okay 1.7 or more pictures are posted okay 1.7 or more pictures are posted okay 1.7 or more than 1.7 million pictures are posted than 1.7 million pictures are posted than 1.7 million pictures are posted similarly we have tweets we have around similarly we have tweets we have around similarly we have tweets we have around 347,000 tweets every minute on Twitter 347,000 tweets every minute on Twitter 347,000 tweets every minute on Twitter this is actually a lot and lot of data this is actually a lot and lot of data this is actually a lot and lot of data right so every time we're using a phone right so every time we're using a phone right so every time we're using a phone we're generating way too much data just we're generating way too much data just we're generating way too much data just watching a video on YouTube is watching a video on YouTube is watching a video on YouTube is generating a lot of data when you're generating a lot of data when you're generating a lot of data when you're sending text messages from WhatsApp that sending text messages from WhatsApp that sending text messages from WhatsApp that is also generating tons and tons of data is also generating tons and tons of data is also generating tons and tons of data now the only problem is not our data now the only problem is not our data now the only problem is not our data generation the problem is that out of generation the problem is that out of generation the problem is that out of all the data that we're generating only all the data that we're generating only all the data that we're generating only 21% of the data is structured and well 21% of the data is structured and well 21% of the data is structured and well formatted the remaining of the data is formatted the remaining of the data is formatted the remaining of the data is unstructured and the major sources of unstructured and the major sources of unstructured and the major sources of unstructured data include text messages unstructured data include text messages unstructured data include text messages from WhatsApp Facebook likes comments on from WhatsApp Facebook likes comments on from WhatsApp Facebook likes comments on Instagram bulk emails that we sent out Instagram bulk emails that we sent out Instagram bulk emails that we sent out every single day all of this accounts every single day all of this accounts every single day all of this accounts for the unstructured data that we have for the unstructured data that we have for the unstructured data that we have today now the question here is what can today now the question here is what can today now the question here is what can done with so much data now the data that done with so much data now the data that done with so much data now the data that we generate can be used to grow we generate can be used to grow we generate can be used to grow businesses by analyzing and Mining the businesses by analyzing and Mining the businesses by analyzing and Mining the data we can add more value to a business data we can add more value to a business data we can add more value to a business this is exactly what text mining is all this is exactly what text mining is all this is exactly what text mining is all about so text mining or text analytics about so text mining or text analytics about so text mining or text analytics is the analysis of data available to us is the analysis of data available to us is the analysis of data available to us in a day-to-day spoken or written in a day-to-day spoken or written in a day-to-day spoken or written language it is amazing that so much data language it is amazing that so much data language it is amazing that so much data that we generate can actually be used in that we generate can actually be used in that we generate can actually be used in text mining we have data from Word text mining we have data from Word text mining we have data from Word Documents PowerPoints chat messages Documents PowerPoints chat messages Documents PowerPoints chat messages emails all of this is used to add value emails all of this is used to add value emails all of this is used to add value to a business now the data that we get to a business now the data that we get to a business now the data that we get from sources like social media iot they from sources like social media iot they from sources like social media iot they are mainly unstructured and unstructured are mainly unstructured and unstructured are mainly unstructured and unstructured data cannot be used to draw useful data cannot be used to draw useful data cannot be used to draw useful insights to grow a business that's insights to grow a business that's insights to grow a business that's exactly why we need text mining text exactly why we need text mining text exactly why we need text mining text mining or text analytics is the process mining or text analytics is the process mining or text analytics is the process of deriving meaningful information from of deriving meaningful information from of deriving meaningful information from natural language text so all the data natural language text so all the data natural language text so all the data that we generate through text messages that we generate through text messages that we generate through text messages emails documents files are written in emails documents files are written in emails documents files are written in natural language text and we are going natural language text and we are going natural language text and we are going to use text Mining and natural language to use text Mining and natural language to use text Mining and natural language processing to draw useful insights or processing to draw useful insights or processing to draw useful insights or patterns from such data now let's look patterns from such data now let's look patterns from such data now let's look at a few examples to show you how at a few examples to show you how at a few examples to show you how natural language processing and text natural language processing and text natural language processing and text mining is used so now before I move any mining is used so now before I move any mining is used so now before I move any further I want to compare text Mining further I want to compare text Mining further I want to compare text Mining and NLP a lot of you might be confused and NLP a lot of you might be confused and NLP a lot of you might be confused about what exactly text mining is and about what exactly text mining is and about what exactly text mining is and how is it related to natural language how is it related to natural language how is it related to natural language processing a lot of people have also processing a lot of people have also processing a lot of people have also asked me why is NLP and text min asked me why is NLP and text min asked me why is NLP and text min considered as one and the same and are considered as one and the same and are considered as one and the same and are they the same thing so basically text they the same thing so basically text they the same thing so basically text mining is a vast field that makes use of mining is a vast field that makes use of mining is a vast field that makes use of natural language processing to derive natural language processing to derive natural language processing to derive high quality information from the text high quality information from the text high quality information from the text so basically text mining is a process so basically text mining is a process so basically text mining is a process and natural language processing is a and natural language processing is a and natural language processing is a method used to carry out text mining so method used to carry out text mining so method used to carry out text mining so in a way you can say that text mining is in a way you can say that text mining is in a way you can say that text mining is the vast field which uses NLP in order the vast field which uses NLP in order the vast field which uses NLP in order to perform text analysis and text mining to perform text analysis and text mining to perform text analysis and text mining right so NLP is a part of of text mining right so NLP is a part of of text mining right so NLP is a part of of text mining now let's understand what exactly now let's understand what exactly now let's understand what exactly natural language processing is now natural language processing is now natural language processing is now natural language processing is a natural language processing is a natural language processing is a component of text mining which basically component of text mining which basically component of text mining which basically helps a machine in reading the text helps a machine in reading the text helps a machine in reading the text obviously machines don't actually know obviously machines don't actually know obviously machines don't actually know English or French right they interpret English or French right they interpret English or French right they interpret data in the form of zeros and ones so data in the form of zeros and ones so data in the form of zeros and ones so this is where natural language this is where natural language this is where natural language processing comes in NLP is what processing comes in NLP is what processing comes in NLP is what computers and smartphones used to computers and smartphones used to computers and smartphones used to understand our language both spoken and understand our language both spoken and understand our language both spoken and written language now because we use written language now because we use written language now because we use language to interact with our device NLP language to interact with our device NLP language to interact with our device NLP became an integral part of our life NLP became an integral part of our life NLP became an integral part of our life NLP uses concepts of computer science and uses concepts of computer science and uses concepts of computer science and artificial intelligence to study the artificial intelligence to study the artificial intelligence to study the data and derive useful information from data and derive useful information from data and derive useful information from it now before we move any further let's it now before we move any further let's it now before we move any further let's look at a few applications of NLP and look at a few applications of NLP and look at a few applications of NLP and text mining now we all spend a lot of text mining now we all spend a lot of text mining now we all spend a lot of time surfing the web have you ever time surfing the web have you ever time surfing the web have you ever noticed that if you start typing a word noticed that if you start typing a word noticed that if you start typing a word on Google you immediately get on Google you immediately get on Google you immediately get suggestions like these this feature is suggestions like these this feature is suggestions like these this feature is also known known as aut to complete it also known known as aut to complete it also known known as aut to complete it will basically suggest the rest of the will basically suggest the rest of the will basically suggest the rest of the word for you and we also have something word for you and we also have something word for you and we also have something known as spam detection here is an known as spam detection here is an known as spam detection here is an example of how Google recognizes the example of how Google recognizes the example of how Google recognizes the misspelling Netflix and shows results misspelling Netflix and shows results misspelling Netflix and shows results for keywords that match your misspelling for keywords that match your misspelling for keywords that match your misspelling so the spam detection is also based on so the spam detection is also based on so the spam detection is also based on the concepts of text Mining and natural the concepts of text Mining and natural the concepts of text Mining and natural language processing next we have language processing next we have language processing next we have predictive typing and spell Checkers predictive typing and spell Checkers predictive typing and spell Checkers features like autocorrect email features like autocorrect email features like autocorrect email classification are all applications of classification are all applications of classification are all applications of text Mining and NLP text Mining and NLP text Mining and NLP now we look at a couple of more now we look at a couple of more now we look at a couple of more applications of natural language applications of natural language applications of natural language processing we have something known as processing we have something known as processing we have something known as sentimental analysis now sentimental sentimental analysis now sentimental sentimental analysis now sentimental analysis is extremely useful in social analysis is extremely useful in social analysis is extremely useful in social media monitoring because it allows us to media monitoring because it allows us to media monitoring because it allows us to gain an overview of The Wider public gain an overview of The Wider public gain an overview of The Wider public opinion behind certain topics so opinion behind certain topics so opinion behind certain topics so basically sentimental analysis is used basically sentimental analysis is used basically sentimental analysis is used to understand The public's opinion or to understand The public's opinion or to understand The public's opinion or customer opinion on a certain product or customer opinion on a certain product or customer opinion on a certain product or on a certain topic sentimental analysis on a certain topic sentimental analysis on a certain topic sentimental analysis is actually a very huge part of a lot of is actually a very huge part of a lot of is actually a very huge part of a lot of social media platforms like Twitter social media platforms like Twitter social media platforms like Twitter Facebook they use sentimental analysis Facebook they use sentimental analysis Facebook they use sentimental analysis very frequently then we have something very frequently then we have something very frequently then we have something known as chatbot chat Bots are basically known as chatbot chat Bots are basically known as chatbot chat Bots are basically the solutions for all the consumer the solutions for all the consumer the solutions for all the consumer frustration regarding customer call frustration regarding customer call frustration regarding customer call assistance so we have companies like assistance so we have companies like assistance so we have companies like Piza Hut Uber who have started using Piza Hut Uber who have started using Piza Hut Uber who have started using chatbots to provide good customer chatbots to provide good customer chatbots to provide good customer service apart from that speech service apart from that speech service apart from that speech recognition NLP has widely been used in recognition NLP has widely been used in recognition NLP has widely been used in speech recognition we're all aware of speech recognition we're all aware of speech recognition we're all aware of Alexa Siri Google assistant and cotana Alexa Siri Google assistant and cotana Alexa Siri Google assistant and cotana these are all applications of natural these are all applications of natural these are all applications of natural language processing machine translation language processing machine translation language processing machine translation is another important application of NLP is another important application of NLP is another important application of NLP an example of this is the Google an example of this is the Google an example of this is the Google translator that uses NLP to process and translator that uses NLP to process and translator that uses NLP to process and translate one language to the other translate one language to the other translate one language to the other other applications include spell other applications include spell other applications include spell Checkers keyword search information Checkers keyword search information Checkers keyword search information extraction and NLP can be used to get extraction and NLP can be used to get extraction and NLP can be used to get useful information from various websites useful information from various websites useful information from various websites from Word documents from files and Etc from Word documents from files and Etc from Word documents from files and Etc it can also be used in advertisement it can also be used in advertisement it can also be used in advertisement matching matching matching this basically means recommendation of this basically means recommendation of this basically means recommendation of ads based on your history so now that ads based on your history so now that ads based on your history so now that you have a basic understanding of where you have a basic understanding of where you have a basic understanding of where natural language processing is used and natural language processing is used and natural language processing is used and what exactly it is let's take a look at what exactly it is let's take a look at what exactly it is let's take a look at some important Concepts so firstly we're some important Concepts so firstly we're some important Concepts so firstly we're going to discuss about tokenization now going to discuss about tokenization now going to discuss about tokenization now tokenization is the most basic step in tokenization is the most basic step in tokenization is the most basic step in text mining tokenization basically means text mining tokenization basically means text mining tokenization basically means breaking down data into smaller chunks breaking down data into smaller chunks breaking down data into smaller chunks or tokens so that they can be easily or tokens so that they can be easily or tokens so that they can be easily analyzed now how tokenization works is analyzed now how tokenization works is analyzed now how tokenization works is it works by breaking a complex sentence it works by breaking a complex sentence it works by breaking a complex sentence into words right so you're breaking a into words right so you're breaking a into words right so you're breaking a huge sentence into words you'll huge sentence into words you'll huge sentence into words you'll understand the importance of each of the understand the importance of each of the understand the importance of each of the word with respect to the whole sentence word with respect to the whole sentence word with respect to the whole sentence after which you'll produce a description after which you'll produce a description after which you'll produce a description on an input sentence so for example on an input sentence so for example on an input sentence so for example let's say we have this sentence tokens let's say we have this sentence tokens let's say we have this sentence tokens are simple if we apply tokenization on are simple if we apply tokenization on are simple if we apply tokenization on this sentence what we get is this right this sentence what we get is this right this sentence what we get is this right we're just breaking a sentence into we're just breaking a sentence into we're just breaking a sentence into words then we understand understanding words then we understand understanding words then we understand understanding the importance of each of these words the importance of each of these words the importance of each of these words right we'll perform NLP process on each right we'll perform NLP process on each right we'll perform NLP process on each of these words to understand how of these words to understand how of these words to understand how important each word is in this entire important each word is in this entire important each word is in this entire sentence for me I think tokens and sentence for me I think tokens and sentence for me I think tokens and simple are important words are is simple are important words are is simple are important words are is basically another stop word we'll be basically another stop word we'll be basically another stop word we'll be discussing about stop wordss in our discussing about stop wordss in our discussing about stop wordss in our further slides but for now you need to further slides but for now you need to further slides but for now you need to understand that tokenization is a very understand that tokenization is a very understand that tokenization is a very simple process that involves breaking simple process that involves breaking simple process that involves breaking sentences into words next we have sentences into words next we have sentences into words next we have something known as stemming stemming is something known as stemming stemming is something known as stemming stemming is basically normalizing words into its basically normalizing words into its basically normalizing words into its base form or into its root form take a base form or into its root form take a base form or into its root form take a look at this example we have words like look at this example we have words like look at this example we have words like detection detecting detected and detection detecting detected and detection detecting detected and detections now we all know that the root detections now we all know that the root detections now we all know that the root word for all these words is detect word for all these words is detect word for all these words is detect basically all these words mean detect so basically all these words mean detect so basically all these words mean detect so the stemming algorithm works by cutting the stemming algorithm works by cutting the stemming algorithm works by cutting off the end or the beginning of the word off the end or the beginning of the word off the end or the beginning of the word and taking into account a list of common and taking into account a list of common and taking into account a list of common prefixes and suffixes that can be found prefixes and suffixes that can be found prefixes and suffixes that can be found in any word word so guys stemming can be in any word word so guys stemming can be in any word word so guys stemming can be successful in some cases but not always successful in some cases but not always successful in some cases but not always that is why a lot of people affirm that that is why a lot of people affirm that that is why a lot of people affirm that stemming has a lot of limitations so in stemming has a lot of limitations so in stemming has a lot of limitations so in order to overcome the limitations of order to overcome the limitations of order to overcome the limitations of stemming we have something known as stemming we have something known as stemming we have something known as lemmatization now what lemmatization lemmatization now what lemmatization lemmatization now what lemmatization does is it takes into consideration the does is it takes into consideration the does is it takes into consideration the morphological analysis of the words to morphological analysis of the words to morphological analysis of the words to do so it is necessary to have a detailed do so it is necessary to have a detailed do so it is necessary to have a detailed dictionary which the algorithm can look dictionary which the algorithm can look dictionary which the algorithm can look through to link the form back to its through to link the form back to its through to link the form back to its Lemma so basically lemmatization is also Lemma so basically lemmatization is also Lemma so basically lemmatization is also quite similar to stemming right it Maps quite similar to stemming right it Maps quite similar to stemming right it Maps different words into one common root now different words into one common root now different words into one common root now sometimes what happens in stemming is sometimes what happens in stemming is sometimes what happens in stemming is that most of the word gets cut off let's that most of the word gets cut off let's that most of the word gets cut off let's say we wanted to cut detection into say we wanted to cut detection into say we wanted to cut detection into detect sometimes it becomes deep or it detect sometimes it becomes deep or it detect sometimes it becomes deep or it becomes Tech or something like that so becomes Tech or something like that so becomes Tech or something like that so because of this the grammar or the because of this the grammar or the because of this the grammar or the importance of the word goes away right importance of the word goes away right importance of the word goes away right you don't know what the word means you don't know what the word means you don't know what the word means anymore due to the indiscriminate anymore due to the indiscriminate anymore due to the indiscriminate cutting of the the word sometimes the cutting of the the word sometimes the cutting of the the word sometimes the grammar or the understanding of the word grammar or the understanding of the word grammar or the understanding of the word is not there anymore so that's why is not there anymore so that's why is not there anymore so that's why lemmatization was introduced the output lemmatization was introduced the output lemmatization was introduced the output of lemmatization is always going to be a of lemmatization is always going to be a of lemmatization is always going to be a proper word okay it's not going to be proper word okay it's not going to be proper word okay it's not going to be something that is half cut or anything something that is half cut or anything something that is half cut or anything like that right you're going to like that right you're going to like that right you're going to understand the morphological analysis understand the morphological analysis understand the morphological analysis and then only you're going to perform and then only you're going to perform and then only you're going to perform lemmatization an example of a lemmatizer lemmatization an example of a lemmatizer lemmatization an example of a lemmatizer is you're going to convert gone going is you're going to convert gone going is you're going to convert gone going and went into go all the three words any and went into go all the three words any and went into go all the three words any way mean the same thing so you're going way mean the same thing so you're going way mean the same thing so you're going to convert it into go we not removing to convert it into go we not removing to convert it into go we not removing the first and the last part of the word the first and the last part of the word the first and the last part of the word what we're doing is we're understanding what we're doing is we're understanding what we're doing is we're understanding the grammar behind the word we the grammar behind the word we the grammar behind the word we understanding the English or the understanding the English or the understanding the English or the morphological analysis of the word and morphological analysis of the word and morphological analysis of the word and only then we are going to perform only then we are going to perform only then we are going to perform lemmatization that's what lemmatization lemmatization that's what lemmatization lemmatization that's what lemmatization is all about now stop words are is all about now stop words are is all about now stop words are basically a set of commonly used words basically a set of commonly used words basically a set of commonly used words in any language not just English now the in any language not just English now the in any language not just English now the reason why stop words are critical to reason why stop words are critical to reason why stop words are critical to many applications is that if we remove many applications is that if we remove many applications is that if we remove the words that are very commonly used in the words that are very commonly used in the words that are very commonly used in a given language we can finally focus on a given language we can finally focus on a given language we can finally focus on the important words for example in the the important words for example in the the important words for example in the context of a search engine let's say you context of a search engine let's say you context of a search engine let's say you open up Google and you try how to make open up Google and you try how to make open up Google and you try how to make strawberry milkshake what the search strawberry milkshake what the search strawberry milkshake what the search engine is going to do is it's going to engine is going to do is it's going to engine is going to do is it's going to find a lot more pages that contain the find a lot more pages that contain the find a lot more pages that contain the terms how to make rather than Pages terms how to make rather than Pages terms how to make rather than Pages which contain the recipe for your which contain the recipe for your which contain the recipe for your strawberry milkshake now that's why you strawberry milkshake now that's why you strawberry milkshake now that's why you have to disregard these terms right the have to disregard these terms right the have to disregard these terms right the search engine can actually focus on your search engine can actually focus on your search engine can actually focus on your strawberry milkshake recipe instead of strawberry milkshake recipe instead of strawberry milkshake recipe instead of looking for pages that have how to and looking for pages that have how to and looking for pages that have how to and so on so that's why you need to remove so on so that's why you need to remove so on so that's why you need to remove these stop words right stop words are these stop words right stop words are these stop words right stop words are how to begin gone various and the all of how to begin gone various and the all of how to begin gone various and the all of these are stop words they are not these are stop words they are not these are stop words they are not necessarily important to understand the necessarily important to understand the necessarily important to understand the importance of the sentence so you get importance of the sentence so you get importance of the sentence so you get rid of these commonly used words so that rid of these commonly used words so that rid of these commonly used words so that you can focus on the actual keywords you can focus on the actual keywords you can focus on the actual keywords another term you need to understand is another term you need to understand is another term you need to understand is document term Matrix a document term document term Matrix a document term document term Matrix a document term Matrix is basically a matrix with Matrix is basically a matrix with Matrix is basically a matrix with documents designated by rows and words documents designated by rows and words documents designated by rows and words by columns so if your document one has by columns so if your document one has by columns so if your document one has this sentence this is fun or has these this sentence this is fun or has these this sentence this is fun or has these words this is fun then you're going to words this is fun then you're going to words this is fun then you're going to get one one one over here in document get one one one over here in document get one one one over here in document two if you see we have this and we have two if you see we have this and we have two if you see we have this and we have is but we do not have fun so that's what is but we do not have fun so that's what is but we do not have fun so that's what a document term Matrix is it is a document term Matrix is it is a document term Matrix is it is basically to understand whether your basically to understand whether your basically to understand whether your document contains each of these words document contains each of these words document contains each of these words right that is a frequency Matrix that is right that is a frequency Matrix that is right that is a frequency Matrix that is what a document term Matrix is now let's what a document term Matrix is now let's what a document term Matrix is now let's move on and look at a natural language move on and look at a natural language move on and look at a natural language processing demo all right so what we're processing demo all right so what we're processing demo all right so what we're going to do is we're going to perform going to do is we're going to perform going to do is we're going to perform sentimental analysis now like I said sentimental analysis now like I said sentimental analysis now like I said sentimental analysis is one of the most sentimental analysis is one of the most sentimental analysis is one of the most popular applications of natural language popular applications of natural language popular applications of natural language processing it refers to the process of processing it refers to the process of processing it refers to the process of determining whether a given piece of determining whether a given piece of determining whether a given piece of text or a given sentence of text is text or a given sentence of text is text or a given sentence of text is positive or negative so in some positive or negative so in some positive or negative so in some variations we consider a sentence to variations we consider a sentence to variations we consider a sentence to also be neutral that's a third option also be neutral that's a third option also be neutral that's a third option and this technique is commonly used to and this technique is commonly used to and this technique is commonly used to discover how people feel about a discover how people feel about a discover how people feel about a particular topic or what are people's particular topic or what are people's particular topic or what are people's opinions about a particular topic so opinions about a particular topic so opinions about a particular topic so this is mainly used to analyze the this is mainly used to analyze the this is mainly used to analyze the sentiments of users in various forms sentiments of users in various forms sentiments of users in various forms such as in marketing campaigns in social such as in marketing campaigns in social such as in marketing campaigns in social media and e-commerce websites and so on media and e-commerce websites and so on media and e-commerce websites and so on so now we'll be performing sentimental so now we'll be performing sentimental so now we'll be performing sentimental analysis using python so we are going to analysis using python so we are going to analysis using python so we are going to perform natural language processing by perform natural language processing by perform natural language processing by using the naive bias classifier that's using the naive bias classifier that's using the naive bias classifier that's why we are importing the naive bias why we are importing the naive bias why we are importing the naive bias classifier so guys python provides a classifier so guys python provides a classifier so guys python provides a library known as natural language library known as natural language library known as natural language toolkit this Library contains all the toolkit this Library contains all the toolkit this Library contains all the functions that are needed to perform functions that are needed to perform functions that are needed to perform natural language processing also in this natural language processing also in this natural language processing also in this Library we have a predefined data set Library we have a predefined data set Library we have a predefined data set called movie reviews what we're going to called movie reviews what we're going to called movie reviews what we're going to do is we're going to download that from do is we're going to download that from do is we're going to download that from our nltk which is natural language our nltk which is natural language our nltk which is natural language toolkit we're basically going to run our toolkit we're basically going to run our toolkit we're basically going to run our analysis on this movie review data set analysis on this movie review data set analysis on this movie review data set right that's exactly what we're doing right that's exactly what we're doing right that's exactly what we're doing over here now what we're doing is we're over here now what we're doing is we're over here now what we're doing is we're defining a function in order to extract defining a function in order to extract defining a function in order to extract features right so this is our function features right so this is our function features right so this is our function is just going to extract all our words is just going to extract all our words is just going to extract all our words now that we've extracted the data we now that we've extracted the data we now that we've extracted the data we need to train it so we'll do that by need to train it so we'll do that by need to train it so we'll do that by using our movie reviews data set that we using our movie reviews data set that we using our movie reviews data set that we just downloaded we're going to just downloaded we're going to just downloaded we're going to understand the positive words and the understand the positive words and the understand the positive words and the negative words so what we're doing here negative words so what we're doing here negative words so what we're doing here is we're just loading our positive and is we're just loading our positive and is we're just loading our positive and our negative reviews we're loading both our negative reviews we're loading both our negative reviews we're loading both of them after that we'll separate each of them after that we'll separate each of them after that we'll separate each of these into positive features and of these into positive features and of these into positive features and negative features this is pretty negative features this is pretty negative features this is pretty understandable next we'll split the data understandable next we'll split the data understandable next we'll split the data into our training and testing set now into our training and testing set now into our training and testing set now this is something that we've been doing this is something that we've been doing this is something that we've been doing for all our demos this is also known as for all our demos this is also known as for all our demos this is also known as data splicing right we've also set a data splicing right we've also set a data splicing right we've also set a threshold factor of 0.8 which basically threshold factor of 0.8 which basically threshold factor of 0.8 which basically means that 80% of your data set will means that 80% of your data set will means that 80% of your data set will belong to your training and 20% will be belong to your training and 20% will be belong to your training and 20% will be for your testing you're going to do this for your testing you're going to do this for your testing you're going to do this even for your positive and your negative even for your positive and your negative even for your positive and your negative words after that you're just extracting words after that you're just extracting words after that you're just extracting the features again and you're just the features again and you're just the features again and you're just printing the number of training data printing the number of training data printing the number of training data points that you have right you're just points that you have right you're just points that you have right you're just printing the length of your training printing the length of your training printing the length of your training features and you're printing the length features and you're printing the length features and you're printing the length of your testing features we can see the of your testing features we can see the of your testing features we can see the output let's run this program so if you see that we're getting program so if you see that we're getting the number of training data points as the number of training data points as the number of training data points as 1,600 and your number of testing data 1,600 and your number of testing data 1,600 and your number of testing data points are 400 there's an 80 to 20 % points are 400 there's an 80 to 20 % points are 400 there's an 80 to 20 % ratio over here after this we'll be ratio over here after this we'll be ratio over here after this we'll be using the knif bu classifier and we'll using the knif bu classifier and we'll using the knif bu classifier and we'll Define the object for The knif Bu Define the object for The knif Bu Define the object for The knif Bu classifier which is basically classifier classifier which is basically classifier classifier which is basically classifier and we'll train this using our training and we'll train this using our training and we'll train this using our training data set we'll also look at the accuracy data set we'll also look at the accuracy data set we'll also look at the accuracy of our model the accuracy of our of our model the accuracy of our of our model the accuracy of our classifier is around 73% which is a classifier is around 73% which is a classifier is around 73% which is a really good number now this classifier really good number now this classifier really good number now this classifier object will actually contain the most object will actually contain the most object will actually contain the most informative words that are obtained informative words that are obtained informative words that are obtained during analysis these words are during analysis these words are during analysis these words are basically essential in understanding basically essential in understanding basically essential in understanding which word is classified as positive and which word is classified as positive and which word is classified as positive and which is classified as negative what which is classified as negative what which is classified as negative what we're doing here is we're going to we're doing here is we're going to we're doing here is we're going to review movies we're going to see which review movies we're going to see which review movies we're going to see which movie review is positive or which movie movie review is positive or which movie movie review is positive or which movie review is negative now this classifier review is negative now this classifier review is negative now this classifier will basically have all the informative will basically have all the informative will basically have all the informative words that will help us decide which is words that will help us decide which is words that will help us decide which is a positive review or a negative review a positive review or a negative review a positive review or a negative review then we're just printing these 10 most then we're just printing these 10 most then we're just printing these 10 most informative informative informative words we have outstanding insulting words we have outstanding insulting words we have outstanding insulting vulnerable l vulnerable l vulnerable l uninvolving astounding avoids uninvolving astounding avoids uninvolving astounding avoids Fascination and so on these are the most Fascination and so on these are the most Fascination and so on these are the most important words in our text now what important words in our text now what important words in our text now what we're going to do is we're going to test we're going to do is we're going to test we're going to do is we're going to test our model I've randomly given some our model I've randomly given some our model I've randomly given some reviews right if you want let's add reviews right if you want let's add reviews right if you want let's add another review we'll another review we'll another review we'll say I loved say I loved say I loved the the the movie so I've added another review over movie so I've added another review over movie so I've added another review over here here we're just printing the review here here we're just printing the review here here we're just printing the review and we're checking if this is a posit and we're checking if this is a posit and we're checking if this is a posit positive review or a negative review now positive review or a negative review now positive review or a negative review now let's look at our predictions right let's look at our predictions right let's look at our predictions right we'll save this and I forgot to put a comma over here and I forgot to put a comma over here save it and let's run the file again so these were our randomly written again so these were our randomly written movie reviews the predicted sentiment is movie reviews the predicted sentiment is movie reviews the predicted sentiment is positive our probability score was 0.61 positive our probability score was 0.61 positive our probability score was 0.61 right it's pretty accurate here now this right it's pretty accurate here now this right it's pretty accurate here now this is a dull movie and I would never is a dull movie and I would never is a dull movie and I would never recommend it is a negative sentiment the recommend it is a negative sentiment the recommend it is a negative sentiment the cinematography is pretty great right cinematography is pretty great right cinematography is pretty great right that's a positive review the movie is that's a positive review the movie is that's a positive review the movie is pathetic is obviously a negative review pathetic is obviously a negative review pathetic is obviously a negative review the direction was terrible and the story the direction was terrible and the story the direction was terrible and the story was all over the place now this is also was all over the place now this is also was all over the place now this is also considered as a negative review considered as a negative review considered as a negative review similarly I loved the movie is what I similarly I loved the movie is what I similarly I loved the movie is what I just inputed and I've got a positive just inputed and I've got a positive just inputed and I've got a positive review on that so our classifi actually review on that so our classifi actually review on that so our classifi actually works really well it's giving us good works really well it's giving us good works really well it's giving us good accuracy and it's classifying the accuracy and it's classifying the accuracy and it's classifying the sentiments very accurately so guys this sentiments very accurately so guys this sentiments very accurately so guys this was all about sentimental analysis here was all about sentimental analysis here was all about sentimental analysis here we basically saw if a movie review was we basically saw if a movie review was we basically saw if a movie review was positive or negative so guys that was positive or negative so guys that was positive or negative so guys that was all for our NLP demo I hope all of you all for our NLP demo I hope all of you all for our NLP demo I hope all of you understood this it was a simple understood this it was a simple understood this it was a simple sentimental analysis that we saw through sentimental analysis that we saw through sentimental analysis that we saw through python so again if you have doubts python so again if you have doubts python so again if you have doubts please leave them in the comment section please leave
