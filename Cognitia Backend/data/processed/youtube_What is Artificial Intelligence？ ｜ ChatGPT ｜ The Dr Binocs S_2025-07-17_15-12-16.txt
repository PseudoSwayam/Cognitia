[Music] [Music] hey little kitty so how's the new AI hey little kitty so how's the new AI hey little kitty so how's the new AI system working well that's an answer we all must know well that's an answer we all must know to keep up with the changing time so in to keep up with the changing time so in to keep up with the changing time so in today's episode let me answer this today's episode let me answer this today's episode let me answer this technological revolutionary question technological revolutionary question technological revolutionary question what is artificial intelligence zoom in what is artificial intelligence zoom in what is artificial intelligence zoom in so you ever heard of Alexa or Siri or so you ever heard of Alexa or Siri or so you ever heard of Alexa or Siri or seen a self-driving car or have you ever seen a self-driving car or have you ever seen a self-driving car or have you ever wondered how your phone's face wondered how your phone's face wondered how your phone's face recognition works well believe it or not recognition works well believe it or not recognition works well believe it or not all of these technologies have something all of these technologies have something all of these technologies have something in common and that is they use in common and that is they use in common and that is they use artificial intelligence or AI to perform artificial intelligence or AI to perform artificial intelligence or AI to perform a task and what is that a task and what is that a task and what is that well before I answer that let's see what well before I answer that let's see what well before I answer that let's see what the word intelligence stands for the word intelligence stands for the word intelligence stands for intelligence is the ability to gain and intelligence is the ability to gain and intelligence is the ability to gain and apply Knowledge and Skills for example apply Knowledge and Skills for example apply Knowledge and Skills for example when we learn the alphabet A to Z in when we learn the alphabet A to Z in when we learn the alphabet A to Z in kindergarten we acquired this kindergarten we acquired this kindergarten we acquired this information and can use it to create information and can use it to create information and can use it to create words sentences or even solve many words sentences or even solve many words sentences or even solve many problems problems problems similarly when a robot or computer uses similarly when a robot or computer uses similarly when a robot or computer uses the information programmed into it to the information programmed into it to the information programmed into it to solve problems it is also using a form solve problems it is also using a form solve problems it is also using a form of intelligence however this type of of intelligence however this type of of intelligence however this type of intelligence is different from Human intelligence is different from Human intelligence is different from Human intelligence it is called artificial intelligence it is called artificial intelligence it is called artificial intelligence or ai intelligence or ai intelligence or ai ai systems are designed to be able to ai systems are designed to be able to ai systems are designed to be able to learn from their experiences adapt to learn from their experiences adapt to learn from their experiences adapt to new situations and make decisions based new situations and make decisions based new situations and make decisions based on the available information but the on the available information but the on the available information but the crucial question is is it really helpful crucial question is is it really helpful crucial question is is it really helpful to us to us to us AI can be used in many ways from helping AI can be used in many ways from helping AI can be used in many ways from helping humans perform tasks more efficiently to humans perform tasks more efficiently to humans perform tasks more efficiently to allowing machines to perform tasks that allowing machines to perform tasks that allowing machines to perform tasks that would be difficult or impossible for would be difficult or impossible for would be difficult or impossible for humans to do for example AI can be used humans to do for example AI can be used humans to do for example AI can be used in robots to help them do tasks in in robots to help them do tasks in in robots to help them do tasks in factories factories factories or hospitals or hospitals or hospitals or in self-driving cars to help them or in self-driving cars to help them or in self-driving cars to help them navigate roads and avoid accidents navigate roads and avoid accidents navigate roads and avoid accidents one of the best things about AI is that one of the best things about AI is that one of the best things about AI is that it can process and analyze lots of data it can process and analyze lots of data it can process and analyze lots of data very quickly and accurately very quickly and accurately very quickly and accurately this makes it a useful tool in many this makes it a useful tool in many this makes it a useful tool in many different Industries like healthcare different Industries like healthcare different Industries like healthcare finance and Retail where lots of data finance and Retail where lots of data finance and Retail where lots of data needs to be analyzed to make good and needs to be analyzed to make good and needs to be analyzed to make good and quick decisions so in a way it is a very quick decisions so in a way it is a very quick decisions so in a way it is a very powerful tool that is Transforming Our powerful tool that is Transforming Our powerful tool that is Transforming Our Lives Lives Lives but as they say with great power comes but as they say with great power comes but as they say with great power comes great responsibility great responsibility great responsibility so it's vital to use AI systems so it's vital to use AI systems so it's vital to use AI systems responsibly and not become too dependent responsibly and not become too dependent responsibly and not become too dependent on them as it can make us more reliant on them as it can make us more reliant on them as it can make us more reliant on technology and less self-sufficient on technology and less self-sufficient on technology and less self-sufficient this could potentially lead to decrease this could potentially lead to decrease this could potentially lead to decrease in motivation and a decrease in physical in motivation and a decrease in physical in motivation and a decrease in physical and mental activity which would directly and mental activity which would directly and mental activity which would directly affect our health affect our health affect our health on top of that the biggest concern with on top of that the biggest concern with on top of that the biggest concern with the AI system is that it has the the AI system is that it has the the AI system is that it has the potential to disrupt existing Industries potential to disrupt existing Industries potential to disrupt existing Industries and potentially replace human workers and potentially replace human workers and potentially replace human workers leading to mass unemployment therefore leading to mass unemployment therefore leading to mass unemployment therefore it is vital to ensure that its it is vital to ensure that its it is vital to ensure that its development and uses are Guided by development and uses are Guided by development and uses are Guided by ethical principles to maximize its ethical principles to maximize its ethical principles to maximize its benefits and minimize its potential benefits and minimize its potential benefits and minimize its potential negative impacts negative impacts negative impacts crave your time did you know one of the crave your time did you know one of the crave your time did you know one of the earliest milestones in the development earliest milestones in the development earliest milestones in the development of AI was the creation of the first of AI was the creation of the first of AI was the creation of the first computer program designed to play chess computer program
