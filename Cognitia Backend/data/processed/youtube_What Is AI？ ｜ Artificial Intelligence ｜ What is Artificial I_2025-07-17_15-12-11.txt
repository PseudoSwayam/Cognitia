picture this a machine that could picture this a machine that could organize your cupboard just as you like organize your cupboard just as you like organize your cupboard just as you like it or serve every member of the house a it or serve every member of the house a it or serve every member of the house a customized cup of coffee makes your day customized cup of coffee makes your day customized cup of coffee makes your day easier doesn't it these are the products easier doesn't it these are the products easier doesn't it these are the products of artificial intelligence but why use of artificial intelligence but why use of artificial intelligence but why use the term artificial intelligence well the term artificial intelligence well the term artificial intelligence well these machines are artificially these machines are artificially these machines are artificially incorporated with human-like incorporated with human-like incorporated with human-like intelligence to perform tasks as we do intelligence to perform tasks as we do intelligence to perform tasks as we do this intelligence is built using complex this intelligence is built using complex this intelligence is built using complex algorithms and mathematical functions algorithms and mathematical functions algorithms and mathematical functions but ai may not be as obvious as in the but ai may not be as obvious as in the but ai may not be as obvious as in the previous examples in fact ai is used in previous examples in fact ai is used in previous examples in fact ai is used in smartphones cars social media feeds smartphones cars social media feeds smartphones cars social media feeds video games banking surveillance and video games banking surveillance and video games banking surveillance and many other aspects of our daily life the many other aspects of our daily life the many other aspects of our daily life the real question is what does an ai do at real question is what does an ai do at real question is what does an ai do at its core here is a robot we built in our its core here is a robot we built in our its core here is a robot we built in our lab which is now dropped onto a field in lab which is now dropped onto a field in lab which is now dropped onto a field in spite of a variation in lighting spite of a variation in lighting spite of a variation in lighting landscape and dimensions of the field landscape and dimensions of the field landscape and dimensions of the field the ai robot must perform as expected the ai robot must perform as expected the ai robot must perform as expected this ability to react appropriately to a this ability to react appropriately to a this ability to react appropriately to a new situation is called generalized new situation is called generalized new situation is called generalized learning the robot is now at a crossroad learning the robot is now at a crossroad learning the robot is now at a crossroad one that is paved and the other rocky one that is paved and the other rocky one that is paved and the other rocky the robot must determine which path to the robot must determine which path to the robot must determine which path to take based on the circumstances this take based on the circumstances this take based on the circumstances this portrays the robot's reasoning ability portrays the robot's reasoning ability portrays the robot's reasoning ability after a short stroll the robot now after a short stroll the robot now after a short stroll the robot now encounters a stream that it cannot swim encounters a stream that it cannot swim encounters a stream that it cannot swim across using the plank provided as an across using the plank provided as an across using the plank provided as an input the robot is able to cross this input the robot is able to cross this input the robot is able to cross this stream so our robot uses the given input stream so our robot uses the given input stream so our robot uses the given input and finds the solution for a problem and finds the solution for a problem and finds the solution for a problem this is problem solving these three this is problem solving these three this is problem solving these three capabilities make the robot artificially capabilities make the robot artificially capabilities make the robot artificially intelligent in short ai provides intelligent in short ai provides intelligent in short ai provides machines with the capability to adapt machines with the capability to adapt machines with the capability to adapt reason and provide solutions reason and provide solutions reason and provide solutions well now that we know what ai is let's well now that we know what ai is let's well now that we know what ai is let's have a look at the two broad categories have a look at the two broad categories have a look at the two broad categories an ais classified into an ais classified into an ais classified into weak ai also called narrow ai focuses weak ai also called narrow ai focuses weak ai also called narrow ai focuses solely on one task solely on one task solely on one task for example alphago is a maestro of the for example alphago is a maestro of the for example alphago is a maestro of the game go but you can't expect it to be game go but you can't expect it to be game go but you can't expect it to be even remotely good at chess even remotely good at chess even remotely good at chess this makes alphago a weak ai this makes alphago a weak ai this makes alphago a weak ai you might say alexa is definitely not a you might say alexa is definitely not a you might say alexa is definitely not a weak ai since it can perform multiple weak ai since it can perform multiple weak ai since it can perform multiple tasks tasks tasks well that's not really true when you ask well that's not really true when you ask well that's not really true when you ask alexa to play despacito it picks up the alexa to play despacito it picks up the alexa to play despacito it picks up the keywords play and despacito keywords play and despacito keywords play and despacito and runs a program and is trained to and runs a program and is trained to and runs a program and is trained to alexa cannot respond to a question it alexa cannot respond to a question it alexa cannot respond to a question it isn't trained to answer for instance try isn't trained to answer for instance try isn't trained to answer for instance try asking alexa the status of traffic from asking alexa the status of traffic from asking alexa the status of traffic from work to home work to home work to home alexa cannot provide you this alexa cannot provide you this alexa cannot provide you this information as she is not trained to and information as she is not trained to and information as she is not trained to and that brings us to our second category of that brings us to our second category of that brings us to our second category of ai strong ai ai strong ai ai strong ai now this is much like the robots that now this is much like the robots that now this is much like the robots that only exist in fiction as of now only exist in fiction as of now only exist in fiction as of now ultron from avengers is an ideal example ultron from avengers is an ideal example ultron from avengers is an ideal example of a strong ai of a strong ai of a strong ai that's because it's self-aware and that's because it's self-aware and that's because it's self-aware and eventually even develops emotions eventually even develops emotions eventually even develops emotions this makes the ai's response this makes the ai's response this makes the ai's response unpredictable unpredictable unpredictable you must be wondering well how is you must be wondering well how is you must be wondering well how is artificial intelligence different from artificial intelligence different from artificial intelligence different from machine learning and deep learning machine learning and deep learning machine learning and deep learning we saw what ai is machine learning is a we saw what ai is machine learning is a we saw what ai is machine learning is a technique to achieve ai and deep technique to achieve ai and deep technique to achieve ai and deep learning in turn is a subset of machine learning in turn is a subset of machine learning in turn is a subset of machine learning learning learning machine learning provides a machine with machine learning provides a machine with machine learning provides a machine with the capability to learn from data and the capability to learn from data and the capability to learn from data and experience through algorithms experience through algorithms experience through algorithms deep learning does this learning through deep learning does this learning through deep learning does this learning through ways inspired by the human brain this ways inspired by the human brain this ways inspired by the human brain this means through deep learning data and means through deep learning data and means through deep learning data and patterns can be better perceived patterns can be better perceived
